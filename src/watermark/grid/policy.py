"""Derive the federal backdrop: energy policy levers + federal output/statistics (#98).

The TOP of the grid & regulatory stack (epic #93). Two halves, both read against the
campus load (the first-class ``facility_draw`` from :mod:`watermark.facility.power`, issue
#87) so the facility's demand is situated against the federal backdrop:

1. **Policy levers.** The federal clean-energy POLICY LEVERS that bear on a load /
   generation of this profile - the IRA section 45 PTC / section 48 ITC and their
   tech-neutral successors (section 45Y / 48E), section 45V clean hydrogen, section
   45X advanced manufacturing, the DOE Loan Programs Office, and DOE grid-resilience
   (section 40101) - each mapped to *what it applies to* and its *direction on cost*
   (a direction, never a quantified offset).

2. **Federal output / statistics.** US national energy OUTPUT and price series (EIA):
   total electricity net generation, the data-center share of US load (now and the
   2028 projection), and the average retail price trend. This is the macro pressure
   the consumer-cost thread (issue #91) needs as its national backdrop.

The integration is the **campus-vs-national** view: the campus annual consumption
expressed as a share of US data-center load and of US total net generation. That is
what feeds #91 - the campus sized against the national data-center demand wave.

Data discipline (epic #93). Nothing here is a facility disclosure. The federal figures
are TRANSCRIBED published values (EIA national, the LBNL/DOE data-center report, the IRA
statute / IRS guidance), each ``reference``-tagged at ``confidence="medium"`` with a
source citation and flagged for verification / regeneration via EIA. Policy levers
carry their statute and cost direction as :class:`watermark.grid.model.CitedFact`. The
campus-vs-national shares are ``derived`` from ``facility_draw``. Applicability is
direction-of-cost only - it depends on the campus's undisclosed generation / procurement
choices, so it is a backdrop, not a claim about this facility.
