"""The boom-origin hypotheses — the third axis, as first-class data.

BOSC asks one question across a network of watershed-point sites: *what explains the
data-center boom?* The platform holds several competing readings of that question — the
**hypotheses** (the frontend calls each a "lens"):

* **H1 Water & Coercion** — compute lands where it can pull power and water; the CWA
  discharge backstop structurally compels municipal acceptance. The reference thesis,
  fully assembled at Lima.
* **H2 Defense & Federal Enclave** — the build-out tracks arsenals, air bases, federal
  research, and the CHIPS program. *Emerging — under test.*
* **H3 Consumer Surveillance** — the operators behind shell LLCs, the public-subsidy
  stack that pulls them in, and the consumer surveillance apparatus the compute serves.
  *Emerging — under test.*

A :class:`Hypothesis` is the *content* of one reading (claim, thesis, the evidence it
predicts); presentation (accent colors, column widths) stays in the frontend. A
:class:`HypothesisAssessment` is the join object this module exists to make real: one
``(site x hypothesis)`` **evidence cell**, carrying a signal strength, an evidentiary
:attr:`~HypothesisAssessment.tag`, the per-hypothesis fields, and — the upgrade over the
old hardcoded TypeScript — a :class:`Citation` for provenance. Cells are committed under
``data/hypotheses/<hypothesis-id>/<site-slug>.yaml`` (hand-authored, or promoted from a
``bosc research run --recipe hypothesis-assessment``).

This is **not** :class:`watermark.hydrology.hypothesis.Hypothesis`, which tags water-balance
*scenarios* by level (macro/local/site). That one frames the Lima loop's numbers; this
one frames the *network* against the origin of the boom. They are deliberately separate.

The peer modules are :mod:`watermark.sites` (the site axis) and :mod:`watermark.research` (the
agent that fills cells). Mirrors ``watermark.sites`` conventions: a frozen registry, a
``data/`` loader, and a readiness lint surfaced by the ``bosc hypotheses`` CLI.
