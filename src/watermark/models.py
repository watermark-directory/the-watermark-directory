    Deliberately its own model rather than an :class:`IndustrialDischargePermit` or an
    :class:`EpaPermitAction`. Routed through the IDP model it would read as a permit
    with an expiration date and **no limits** — indistinguishable from a permit that
    imposes none. Routed through the EPA model it would put "City of Lima" in an
    ``agency`` field whose whole scope is Ohio EPA / USACE surface-water actions, so a
    consumer filtering agency correspondence would collect a municipal sewer letter.
    Nothing here is a permit condition: the letter changes exactly one term of an
    instrument it does not otherwise restate.

    ``extended_to`` is the payload and the reason this genre exists. A permit extended
    by letter is a permit whose printed expiration date no longer says when it expires,
    so the face of the permit stops being able to answer whether the user is currently
    covered — only the letter chain can. Lima extended P&G Main three times
    (2026-05-13, 2026-07-13, 2026-09-13) and Metokote once (2026-09-11); a gap after the
    last extension with no successor permit produced is an uncovered discharge, which is
    a finding no single document in the production states.

    ``reason`` is transcribed because the City sometimes gives one ("currently in the
    process of revising P&G Main Facility's IDP") and sometimes does not, and the
    difference is evidence about the program's own account of the delay.

    value**, and this envelope declares none of them: a synthetic ``doc_id`` or a ``dpi: 300``
    would assert a method that did not happen, which the corpus's chain-of-custody rule forbids

    prevents: ``oepa/van-wert/2GC08872.approval.npdes.yaml`` opens "HAND-READ, not a vision
    extraction … nothing was OCR'd" and then carries ``dpi: 150``, because the type it was
    written against demanded one. A transcription carrying a partial receipt is either a real
