    instruments in the 2026-07-24 PRR production, ``regulatory/west-union/

    at 600 DPI (pypdfium2), all 10 pages"), which is why they name the pages they read and refuse
    to name a ``dpi``: no single render receipt describes the read.

    ``pages_read`` must be DECLARED — a list, and the test is that it is one, not that it is

    anything keying a genre payload that is neither a render nor one of these still routes to its
