"""Stage 2 — extract.

Turn a scanned cost-estimate page into a reviewed, structured extraction.

The flow is **hybrid** (see the read-mode decision):

1. Pull the page's embedded OCR text via :class:`PdfDocument` — a cheap
   *structural* hint (section names, item ordering). Its digits are unreliable.
2. Render the page to a 300 DPI image — the *authoritative* source.
3. Resolve a format :class:`~watermark.profiles.Profile` (explicit or auto-detected
   from the OCR text), build its prompt, and force a Claude model to populate a
   contractor-agnostic :class:`~watermark.models.Estimate` (tool use + validation).
4. Wrap the result with provenance into a :class:`PageExtraction`.

Extraction is dispatched by *document kind* (``opc`` today) via
:data:`EXTRACTORS`, leaving room for other public-records genres later.

  * agency: the recipients (e.g. "U.S. EPA Region 5 / Ohio EPA"); instrument: what it
    reports under (e.g. "consent decree"); paragraph: the reporting clause number ("33").
  * case_no: the CASE NUMBER ALONE and nothing else. These reports cite the decree as
    "CASE: 3:14-CV-02551-JZ Doc #5 Filed: 01/13/15" — the case number is
    "3:14-CV-02551-JZ"; "Doc #5 Filed: 01/13/15" identifies one FILING inside it and does
    not belong in this field. A row carrying the docket entry will not join the order
    extraction for the same case. Put the filing citation in `note` if it is worth keeping.
  * respondent (the filing party); facility; permit_no if referenced.
  * report_date (ISO — filed/received) and period_start / period_end (ISO) for the
    reporting period. These reports name the period explicitly ("Previous Calendar half
    year Progress Report Period 7/1/2019 to 12/31/2019"); read it, do not infer it from
    the filing date.
  * deadlines_status: clause (a) — the deadlines and terms due this period and whether
    they were met. If the report says "None", record "None" rather than leaving it null:
    an explicit nothing-due is evidence. noncompliance_reasons: the reasons it states.
  * projects: clause (b) — one entry per NAMED project, with `status` for this period and
    `next_period` for the projected work. Keep the report's own project names.
  * agency_contacts: clause (d) — each dated deliverable or material contact as printed.
  * permit_exceedances: clause (e) — one entry per exceedance, as printed. An explicit
    "none" is an empty list plus a note, never a fabricated entry.
  * discharge_events: clause (f) — one entry per CSO / SSO / bypass / unpermitted
    discharge, with kind, date, frequency, duration and volume AS PRINTED. Keep the printed
    units; do NOT convert. Set `estimated` true only where the report itself says the figure
    is estimated rather than measured.
    Put the PERMIT OUTFALL ID (the "2PE00000NNN" form) in `outfall_id` and the street or
    structure description in `location`, never both in one field — these reports print one
    or the other in different periods for the same physical point, and an outfall that does
    not join itself across periods makes the series useless. A bare 3-digit row number from
    the table is NOT an outfall id; leave `outfall_id` null for it.
    If the report states a TOTAL for the period that exceeds the rows you can read, say so
    in a warning and give both numbers. An enumeration that silently covers part of a
    period reads as the whole of it.
  * summary: 1-3 sentences on what this period reports.
Rules: dates as ISO; figures and project names exactly as printed; a self-report is the
filer's assertion, so never upgrade it to a finding; leave a field null rather than
inventing; set confidence and add warnings for strained reads.

You are reading a civil / utility ENGINEERING record — an as-built (record)
drawing set, a construction plan set, or a component specification. It may be any
discipline: sanitary sewer / pump station, water main, stormwater, electrical,
structural. The pages are SCANNED drawings: the image is authoritative; any text
layer is unreliable or absent. Read the titleblock, the drawing index, the legend,
the schedules/tables (pump schedule, pipe schedule, equipment list), and the
on-drawing callouts. Record into the tool, GENERICALLY (do not force the data into
one discipline):
  * project_name; facility_name (the asset itself, e.g. "Indian Brook Pump
    Station"); record_type (as-built | record drawing | construction plans |
    specification); discipline (read it off the drawing: sanitary | water |
    stormwater | electrical | structural | ...); record_date (ISO if legible);
    project_no; site_address.
  * prepared_by: each design / engineering firm on the titleblock, with its
    discipline and location if shown.
  * sheets: the drawing index — each sheet's id (e.g. "C-1", "M-3", "1 of 4") and
    title. This is the IMPLEMENTATION-LAYOUT axis: how the set is organized.
  * components: the COMPONENT-SPECIFICATION axis. One entry per physical component
    the drawings install or specify — a pipe run (e.g. "forcemain"), a structure
    (wet well, manhole, vault), a pump, a valve, a tank, an electrical unit. For
    each: name; category (pipe | pump | structure | valve | tank | equipment |
    electrical | ...); quantity if stated; and specs: a list of {parameter, value,
    unit} read off the schedules / callouts — e.g. {parameter: "diameter",
    value: "8", unit: "in"}, {parameter: "material", value: "ductile iron"},
    {parameter: "capacity", value: "150", unit: "gpm"}, {parameter: "TDH",
    value: "45", unit: "ft"}, {parameter: "manufacturer", value: "Flygt"}.
  * design_parameters: system-level design figures NOT tied to one component —
    e.g. {parameter: "peak design flow", value: "1.2", unit: "MGD"},
    {parameter: "firm capacity", value: "~450", unit: "gpm"}. Same {parameter,
    value, unit} shape.
  * key_features: notable callouts worth surfacing; summary: 1-3 sentences on what
    the record documents and what the asset is.
Rules: figures come from the IMAGE, never a garbled text layer. Copy numbers,
sizes, and names exactly as printed; keep the value as printed (a figure, a
material, a model). Mark an APPROXIMATE numeric read with a leading "~" in value
(e.g. "~150") AND add a warning — never silently round. Leave a field null / a
list empty rather than inventing a component, spec, or firm. Set confidence and add
a warning for any schedule or callout you had to strain to read.
