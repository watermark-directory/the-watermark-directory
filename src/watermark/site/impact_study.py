"""The ``impact-study`` bundle feed (#1804, epic #1803 P1) — the study's data spine, exported.

The missing-impact-study epic (PRs #1795-#1802) built each site's primary artifact — the
environmental + economic impact study communities never receive — as a frontend derivation:
``web/packages/core/src/study.ts`` composes a per-chapter verdict + model from the bundle's
feeds at the Astro build. This module is that derivation's **Python realization**: a pure
post-pass PROJECTION over the feeds ``export_bundle`` has already assembled (the
``open_questions`` pattern — no corpus re-load, no new claims), emitting one
:class:`~watermark.site.feeds.ImpactStudyItem` per study chapter so the study ships as a
committed, citable, catalogued artifact.

**Parity is the contract.** The frontend prefers a shipped row WHOLESALE (exact
``(chapter, facility_key)`` match) over its TS composers, so a divergence here silently
changes a published verdict. Every derivation below — the chapter registry, the status
rules (row counts + content probes, never presence alone), the probe copy, the composer
output down to the JS number formatting — mirrors ``study.ts`` line-for-line, and the
frontend's ``study.parity.test.ts`` pins the two derivations equal over every committed
bundle. Change the two files together or not at all.

Three disciplines carry over verbatim (see the ``study.ts`` module header):

- **The study never locks.** An absent feed is content (a ``gap`` finding or an ``na``
  watch state), never a lock; ``hasEnough`` semantics are deliberately not consulted.
- **Verdicts measure the record, not the lifecycle.** A facility's
  ``investigation → live`` clock changes framing copy only.
- **Multi-project forward-compat, no compute change.** Rows are keyed
  ``(chapter, facility_key)`` and emit the resolved PRIMARY campus only; a second campus
  later gets its own rows without rearchitecting.

The curated gap → lead joins (``STUDY_GAP_LEADS``) live here now — ONE owner (the TS copy
retired with the feed cutover). Strictly curated, never a fuzzy keyword match; an id that
stops reconciling against the site's own ``leads`` feed **fails the export loudly** rather
than shipping a dangling join (the drift-test discipline, moved to the producer).

    Every headline stat used to round to one decimal, which suited the magnitudes this study was
    first built on. Two separate findings say it does not suit the ones it works in now, and both
    are about the same thing: a design low flow is a sub-1 number, and one decimal cannot carry it.

    The first was a value that VANISHED. Sidney's contracted cooling draw is 0.0146 cfs (3.44M
    gal/yr, `[verified]` in an executed service agreement) and rendered as **"0 cfs"** — a reader
    takes that as *no draw*, a different claim from *a very small one* and the wrong one (#1995).

    The second is a value that merely SHIFTED, which is subtler and was live in three committed
    bundles. Van Wert's Town Creek 7Q10 is **0.16 cfs** and published as **"0.2"** — off by 25%,
    on the denominator its whole effluent-dominance finding rests on (0.16 cfs against a 6.19 cfs
    design discharge is the 0.03:1 dilution the screen flags as a violation). It did not vanish,
    so the first fix's guard never fired. Findlay's 0.21 and Lima's low flow had the same shift.

    So the rule is stated once, for the whole sub-1 range, rather than patched per symptom: below
    1 a stat keeps **two significant figures**. That subsumes the vanish guard exactly — it is the
    same ``1 - floor(log10)`` expression, just no longer gated on the value rounding to zero — and
    leaves everything at or above 1 untouched. Four committed stats move, three of them the
