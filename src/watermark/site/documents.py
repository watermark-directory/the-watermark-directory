"""Catalog the full source-document corpus as typed library feeds.

Mission goal (1): *present a downloadable form of each document.* The raw corpus
under ``data/documents`` is ~5 GB across ~1,500 files — far too large to
republish onto a static host — so this exports a complete **catalog** instead
(:func:`export_documents` → :class:`~watermark.site.feeds.DocumentCollectionItem`),
listing every source file with its size and type. Direct downloads are wired only
for the curated :mod:`watermark.site.exhibits`; the rest are catalogued with their
repo-relative path so the record is transparent even when the bytes aren't
republished. (The legacy markdown ``render_documents`` peer was removed at the
SSG-cutover cleanup, #603.)

Set ``settings.documents_mirror_base_url`` to an external mirror (Archive.org /
S3 / Drive) to turn every catalogued file into a direct download link.

Chain of custody: this only *reads* and *links* source files — it never copies,
renames, or alters a byte under ``data/documents``.
