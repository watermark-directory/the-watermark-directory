"""Project the BOSC corpus into yidam node format (Epic #1560, E1 · #1561).

``yidam overlay`` bootstraps an **empty** ``.yidam/corpus/``; every yidam report
(``corpus-index``, ``graph-check``, ``open-questions``), MCP resource, and the vector
index read *node files* from there. yidam does **not** read BOSC's Pydantic/YAML/markdown
corpus. This module is the bridge: ``watermark corpus-mirror`` projects the committed
corpus — entities, relationships, the wiki concepts, profiled people, the per-site leads
board, the boom-origin hypotheses, and the ``[open]`` claims — into yidam corpus nodes.

**The yidam node format** (from the `goedelsoup/yidam` CLI — `walk.rs`/`parse.rs`/`corpus.rs`,
which are the ground truth, not the prose docs). A corpus lives under ``.yidam/corpus/``:

* ``<class>.ont.yml`` — one class-schema file per node *kind*, at the corpus root.
* ``<class>/<name>.yml`` — one instance node per file, inside its class dir. Each parses as
  ``{class, label, description?, links: [{target, relationship?}]}``; **unknown keys are
  ignored** by yidam's parser, so a node also carries the BOSC provenance it was projected
  from (``site``, ``scope``, ``claim_tag``, ``source``, …) as extra fields — lossless for
  the downstream index and #1562+ tooling.

The node **kind is the class (directory)**. This mirror uses the five the issue names:

===========  ==================================================================
kind         projected from
===========  ==================================================================
``concept``  the wiki glossary (:class:`~watermark.site.feeds.ConceptItem`)
``relation`` the entity-graph edges (:class:`~watermark.site.feeds.RelationshipEdge`)
``artifact`` the site anchor + resolved entities + profiled people
``question`` the per-site leads board + the ``[open]``-tagged hypothesis claims
``hypothesis`` the network's boom-origin readings (:data:`watermark.hypotheses.HYPOTHESES`)
===========  ==================================================================

**Two hard yidam rules this module must satisfy** (its ``graph-check`` gate, replicated in
:func:`validate_mirror`): every instance has a ``class:`` matching a ``<class>.ont.yml`` and a
``label:``, and **every node emits ≥1 outgoing link whose target file exists**. The projection
guarantees the second by giving every node at least one edge to a node that is always present:
the **site anchor** (``artifact/site-<slug>``, which links out to the three hypothesis nodes).
So the graph is always connected and never orphaned, even for a thin peer site.

**Per-site & regenerable.** The mirror is projected for the active site (``settings.site``);
every node is ``site:``-tagged, and the network-shared kinds (concepts, hypotheses) carry
``scope: network``. The mirror is a git-ignored, regenerated artifact — never a source of
truth (the committed corpus is). Claim tags (``[verified]``/``[inference]``/``[reference]``/
``[open]``) are preserved: leads and open hypothesis claims carry ``claim_tag``; entities and
people carry their sources' :class:`~watermark.provenance.SourceKind` verbatim.

    The mirror stores the token, never the bare word. Two reasons, and the second is
    load-bearing:

    * ``[verified]`` / ``[inference]`` / ``[reference]`` / ``[open]`` **is** the claim
      vocabulary the rest of the corpus is written in, so the bare word was the lossy form.
    * ``yidam open-questions`` decides a node is open by scanning its raw serialized text for
      the literal ``[open]`` (``yidam/cli/src/cmd/mod.rs::has_open_claim``). With the bare
      word the real binary saw 2 open questions in this mirror against the 20 the replica
      reported over the same tree — it matched only the handful of nodes carrying ``[open]``
      somewhere in their prose.

    Readers normalize with ``.strip("[]")`` (:func:`watermark.site.corpus_nodes._evidence`),
    so the bracketing changes no downstream feed value. Idempotent.

    **The inconsistency this used to work around is settled, and the bracketing stays anyway.**
    The two surfaces once disagreed: upstream added a structural route — a class may declare, in
    its ``.ont.yml``, which properties carry an evidence tag (``yidam/cli/src/claims.rs``,
    `goedelsoup/yidam` `6aaf18e`) — so ``yidam open-questions`` would find a bare ``open``,
    while the frozen MCP ``open_questions`` predicate was two arms and forbade that extension by
    name. Filed from here as goedelsoup/yidam#127; upstream resolved it by **widening the
    contract rather than narrowing the CLI**, and at contract 0.13.0 the predicate is three arms
    reading both spellings. Its note names this corpus by measurement: *"the corpus that
    measured 26 open questions against this tool's 2, and reshaped its data to `[open]` to be
    seen at all."*

    So the bracketed token is no longer the *only* form that satisfies both surfaces — but it
    still satisfies every arm of both, and reverting is a data-shape change with nothing to buy
    it. The third arm reads a property a class **declares**, and ``_ont_yaml`` declares none, so
    a bare word here would be invisible to the declaration-reading arm and to the text scan
    alike. The bare form becomes available when the ontology declares the property (#2132) — and
    that is where the decision belongs, with the declaration in front of it.
