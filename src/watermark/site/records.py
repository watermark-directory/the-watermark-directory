"""Export the committed extractions into typed record feeds.

Reads every ``data/extracted/**/*.yaml`` generically — by the shape of its
payload block, in the same idiom :mod:`watermark.pipeline.corpus` classifies by — and emits one
:class:`~watermark.site.feeds.RecordItem` per record. Reading off the raw dict (not the
Pydantic models) keeps this contractor-/genre-agnostic and preserves the ``~``
approximate marker verbatim, per the data discipline in CLAUDE.md. (The legacy
markdown ``render_record_pages`` peer was removed at the SSG-cutover cleanup, #603.)

The classifier is the site tier's own taxonomy, and it is **wider** than the corpus loader's:
:mod:`watermark.pipeline.corpus` routes a genre only where a Pydantic extraction model backs
it, whereas a record here is published from the raw payload. That gap is what let a site's
worked corpus go unpublished — Urbana's structured read of the Thor v. Urbana complaint and
its recorded land-assembly register were both real, cited extractions that no group claimed,
so the site shipped a zero-length ``records`` feed and a ``record`` domain that read `seeded`
over a corpus that was neither absent nor thin (#1724). A genre earns a group when the corpus
carries the artifact; it does not need an extractor to have produced it.

Classification runs three mechanisms, in this order, and the order is the safety property
(#1993). A **payload block** (``_BLOCK_TO_GROUP``) claims a file whose subject fields live under
one key. A **whole-document block** (``_WHOLE_DOC_BLOCK_TO_GROUP``) claims one whose subject is
spread across the top level, and publishes the document minus its envelope and this repo's own
working notes. Last, a ``meta.kind`` **value allowlist** (``_META_KIND_TO_GROUP``) claims the
genres no payload block can discriminate, because their identity lives in the envelope rather
than in a block name — a grid siting case, a filed tariff sheet. That third mechanism must never
be expressed as a ``meta`` entry in either block map: 77 committed extractions carry a top-level
``meta:`` dict, so such an entry would publish every meetings manifest, corpus index, completeness
audit, standing watch and site footprint in the tree, and steal both Fort Wayne IDEM permits and
the OPC summary out of their correct groups. The allowlist, evaluated last, is what makes the
mechanism safe.

What is deliberately *not* a record: the derived per-site models (``bosc-site-footprint.yaml``
— the profile's ``footprint_relpath`` input), the corpus indexes and manifests (``meta:`` +
``documents:``), the meetings pipeline's own machinery (the ``meetings`` feed already publishes
``meeting-summaries.yaml``, so a record would double-count the same evidence), the standing
watches, and the analysis digests (``kind:``/``subject:``/``provenance:``). Those are compiled
*from* the record or *about* it; publishing them as records would float a site's record domain on
its own scaffolding.

#                   ordinance record recited) sits beside it, so keying the payload to the block
#                   would publish a docket stub and drop the filing.
#   `conveyances` — a recorded land-assembly register: one entry per deed (grantor → grantee,

#                   and filing it under `deeds` would present it as an instrument read.
#   `sellers`     — the produced-instrument peer of `conveyances`: one entry per seller's
#                   option-to-purchase packet with grantor/grantee, acreage, parcel IDs and the
#                   assignment/closing chain, read off page images of a records production rather

#                   the block alone would drop the mechanism, the blank DTE-100 conveyance-fee
#                   finding, and the CAUV recoupment (#1993).
#   `zoning_code` — an adopted township zoning resolution in CONSOLIDATED form: the in-force text
#                   as re-adopted, with the definitions and district articles that govern a
#                   campus. `local-legislation` because it is still an act of the trustees, but
#                   whole-document on purpose: the substance is spread across `definitions`, the
#                   district articles and the dimensional schedule, and the payload must carry
#                   the file's own `tag: inference` on which re-adoption introduced the
#                   data-center language. The key is `zoning_code` and not the committed
#                   artifact's original `document:`, which is the most generic wrapper word in
#                   this repo and would silently claim the next extraction that used it.
#   `bill`        — a General Assembly bill read section by section against its own printed text.
#                   NOT `local-legislation`: that group is "an act of a LOCAL legislative body,
#                   journalled in its own minutes", and the whole discriminator is the body that
#                   voted. A statewide bill is a different level of government and, as introduced
#                   or as passed by one chamber, is not law at all — the payload keeps
#                   `provenance.version` so the record renders as pending, never enacted.
#                   Whole-document because `bill:` is a pure identity stub (number, title,
#                   sponsors); every provision read sits beside it.
#   `retention_policy`
#                 — an adopted, signed public-records availability + retention policy of a public
#                   body, produced in a records request. It is an instrument (dated, adopted,
#                   signed), not a compilation, but no group fits: `plans` is a plan document,
#                   `local-legislation` is an act journalled in minutes, and the `permits-*`
#                   family is authorizations. Whole-document because the subject is spread across
#                   `availability_policy` / `retention_policy` / `schedule_*`.
#   `development_agreement`
#                 — a per-site REGISTER of the incentive and development instruments for one
#                   campus: the executed agreements plus the legislative chain that authorized
#                   them, one file per site. Deliberately NOT `agreements`, which is
#                   instrument-level — this is the `conveyances`/`deeds` line drawn again, and the
#                   group NAME carries it, because `load_records` yields ONE record per file and a
#                   register cannot honestly be presented as a single executed instrument. It is
#                   keyed on `development_agreement` and not `cra_agreement` because that is the
#                   one block the two committed registers share; their vocabularies otherwise
#                   differ (`cra_agreement`/`legislative_chain`/`land_acquisition` vs `cra`/
#                   `no_cra_agreement`/`disclosed_economics`), and a single-site rule would leave
#                   the other site unpublished. If a SINGLE executed development agreement is ever
#                   extracted on its own, key it `parties:` so it lands in `agreements`, not here.
#   `parties`     — an executed instrument between a public body and a private party: a mutual
#                   NDA, a roadwork development agreement, an intergovernmental wastewater
#                   treatment agreement, a statutory Community Reinvestment Area agreement. No
#                   existing group fits: `finance` (`award:`) is a grant or contract AWARD, and
#                   filing a 75%/15-year R.C. 3735.65 tax exemption there would present an
#                   exemption as a grant — the misfiling #1724 refused. `local-legislation` is the
#                   ACT that authorized the contract, not the contract. Whole-document because
#                   `parties:` names only the counterparties; the terms, execution and authorizing
#                   resolutions sit beside it.
#                   MUST BE LAST. `findlay/governance/litigation-one-energy-v-allen-twp.yaml`
#                   carries both `case:` and `parties:`, and `case` must keep it. (A consent order
#                   carrying `parties:` is already safe — `order:` is a BLOCK key, and the block
#                   map is scanned before this one.)

#     a "Permits —" heading would tell a reader a 29-mile 345 kV line is permitted when the case is
