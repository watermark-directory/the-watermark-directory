"""The content-bundle contract — typed models for every feed the frontend reads.

These Pydantic models *are* the contract (issue #53, Tier 1). Each ``export_X`` in
the ``watermark.site.*`` modules returns one of these, and :mod:`watermark.site.export` writes
them under ``data/site/bundle/`` with a ``manifest.json`` and a JSON Schema per feed
(generated from these models, so schema and code never drift).

Two primitives carry provenance into every figure-bearing feed (issue #60), so a
consumer can render ``[verified] cite p.X`` or an approximate ``~`` value purely from
the bundle — no re-deriving:

* :class:`Citation` — where a value came from. Its ``source_kind`` maps onto the
  dossier's evidence discipline exactly as :class:`watermark.hydrology.model.ProvenancedValue`
  does (``document``/``connector`` → ``verified``; ``assumption``/``derived`` →
  ``inference``); ``verified`` is a derived boolean the frontend reads directly.
* :class:`Figure` — a number that preserves the ``~`` approximate marker as *data*
  (``approximate: true``), not as formatted text.

The already-provenanced feeds (rsei, lei, economics-baseline, hydrology-scenarios)
export their existing :mod:`bosc` Pydantic models unchanged — they already satisfy the
#60 discipline through ``ProvenancedValue`` / an inventory ``meta.source`` — so this
module only models the feeds whose renderers worked off dataclasses or raw dicts.

# --- bundle contract version ---------------------------------------------------
# Bumped per the back-compat policy in data/site/bundle/README.md: PATCH for additive
# optional fields, MINOR for new feeds, MAJOR for a breaking field change/removal.
# 1.1.0: added the `concepts` feed (issue #68, the wiki concept-glossary store).
# 1.2.0: source-document rendering (epic #274) — `DocumentItem` gains real
#   `media_type`/`render_class` (#275), `RecordItem` gains the `source_doc_*` join (#276).
# 1.3.0: `DocumentItem` gains `published` — the default-deny public allowlist flag (#280).
# 1.4.0: adds the `network` object feed — the cross-site basin synthesis (watermark.network; #308/#323).
# 1.5.0: adds the `hypotheses` + `hypothesis-assessments` feeds — the boom-origin lenses and their
#   (site x hypothesis) evidence cells (watermark.hypotheses; #308). The directory reads these instead of
#   the formerly-hardcoded LENSES/LENS_DATA, so each cell now ships with a Citation.
# 1.6.0: adds the `catalog` feed — the published data catalog (watermark.catalog projected to
#   CatalogItem + the reconcile observed snapshot; epic #631 Phase 3 / #659).
# 1.6.1: the manifest gains `site` — the network-site slug a bundle is for, so it self-identifies
#   (per-site bundle scoping; #762).
# 1.7.0: adds the per-site `leads` feed — the open-leads board read from a committed per-site store
#   (`data/site/leads.yaml`, slug-scoped), so a peer carries its own leads, not Lima's (#796).
# 1.8.0: adds the optional `ask-embeddings` feed — all-MiniLM-L6-v2 document vectors for hybrid
#   BM25 + vector retrieval (#329); absent when `bosc export --no-embeddings` is used.
