"""The content-bundle contract — typed models for every feed the frontend reads.

These Pydantic models *are* the contract (issue #53, Tier 1). Each ``export_X`` in
the ``watermark.site.*`` modules returns one of these, and :mod:`watermark.site.export` writes
them under ``data/site/bundle/`` with a ``manifest.json`` and a JSON Schema per feed
(generated from these models, so schema and code never drift).

Two primitives carry provenance into every figure-bearing feed (issue #60), so a
consumer can render ``[verified] cite p.X`` or an approximate ``~`` value purely from
the bundle — no re-deriving:

* :class:`Citation` — where a value came from. Its ``source_kind`` maps onto the
  dossier's evidence discipline exactly as :class:`watermark.hydrology.model.ProvenancedValue`
  does (``document``/``connector`` → ``verified``; ``assumption``/``derived`` →
  ``inference``); ``verified`` is a derived boolean the frontend reads directly.
* :class:`Figure` — a number that preserves the ``~`` approximate marker as *data*
  (``approximate: true``), not as formatted text.

The already-provenanced feeds (rsei, lei, economics-baseline, hydrology-scenarios)
export their existing :mod:`watermark` Pydantic models unchanged — they already satisfy the
#60 discipline through ``ProvenancedValue`` / an inventory ``meta.source`` — so this
module only models the feeds whose renderers worked off dataclasses or raw dicts.

# --- bundle contract version ---------------------------------------------------
# Bumped per the back-compat policy in data/site/bundle/README.md: PATCH for additive
# optional fields, MINOR for new feeds, MAJOR for a breaking field change/removal.
# 1.1.0: added the `concepts` feed (issue #68, the wiki concept-glossary store).
# 1.2.0: source-document rendering (epic #274) — `DocumentItem` gains real
#   `media_type`/`render_class` (#275), `RecordItem` gains the `source_doc_*` join (#276).
# 1.3.0: `DocumentItem` gains `published` — the default-deny public allowlist flag (#280).
# 1.4.0: adds the `network` object feed — the cross-site basin synthesis (watermark.network; #308/#323).
# 1.5.0: adds the `hypotheses` + `hypothesis-assessments` feeds — the boom-origin hypotheses and their
#   (site x hypothesis) evidence cells (watermark.hypotheses; #308). The directory reads these instead of
#   the formerly-hardcoded frontend tables, so each cell now ships with a Citation.
# 1.6.0: adds the `catalog` feed — the published data catalog (watermark.catalog projected to
#   CatalogItem + the reconcile observed snapshot; epic #631 Phase 3 / #659).
# 1.6.1: the manifest gains `site` — the network-site slug a bundle is for, so it self-identifies
#   (per-site bundle scoping; #762).
# 1.7.0: adds the per-site `leads` feed — the open-leads board read from a committed per-site store
#   (`data/site/leads.yaml`, slug-scoped), so a peer carries its own leads, not Lima's (#796).
# 1.8.0: adds the optional `ask-embeddings` feed — all-MiniLM-L6-v2 document vectors for hybrid
#   BM25 + vector retrieval (#329); absent when `watermark export --no-embeddings` is used.
# 1.9.0: `hydrology-scenarios` rows gain `cooling_model` (top-level, on the scenario, and on its
#   basis) plus the basis honesty flags `method_disclosed` / `is_bracketed` and the hybrid
#   `seasonal_months` — the cooling-model typology (epic #1060). An `unknown` model means the
#   method is undisclosed: render the bracketed range, never a single headline (#1057).
# 1.10.0: keep annual time series (issue #1111). `economics-baseline` trend points (`YearTotal`)
#   gain `establishments` and now span a decade (QCEW 2014-2024, not two years); adds the
#   `consumer-energy` feed — the EIA state price/sales dataset with each series' full annual
#   history (`points`) plus its latest cited value, so the site can chart price trends.
# 1.11.0: adds the `catalog-index` object feed — the hydrated catalog of addressable "grabbable"
#   atoms (handle grammar `<kind>:<site>:<local_id>`) the user-authored Stories write/read paths
#   resolve against, plus `catalog_version` for handle-drift revalidation (epic #1090 / #1093).
# 1.12.0: adds the `economics-demand-pressure` object feed (#1105) — the facility demand→consumer-
#   price-pressure sensitivity (`FacilityDemandPressure`): households-equivalent, demand share, and
#   the STYLIZED price-pressure band, each a `ProvenancedValue`. Facility-gated — absent for a thin
#   site with no documented facility (mirrors `derive_demand_pressure`'s own gate).
# 1.13.0: adds the `routed-hydrograph` object feed (#1184) — the loop's design-storm hydrograph
#   routed down the cited confluence graph via Muskingum-Cunge (`RoutedHydrographNetwork`): the
#   routed vs. naive-summed outlet hydrograph series, the peak `attenuation_pct` + `lag_hr`, the
#   per-reach attenuation/lag table, and the `site` label. Absent when the topology or reach
#   table is missing.
# 1.14.0: the cooling `basis` (`CoolingBasis`, embedded in `hydrology-scenarios`) gains the optional
#   `makeup_high` ProvenancedValue — the campus intake at the upper consumptive bound (#1153), read
#   by refill instead of back-calculating consumptive_high/consumptive_fraction across incompatible
#   per-archetype bases. Additive/optional: absent (null) for the fraction-uncertainty archetypes.
# 1.15.0: `economics-baseline` surfaces QCEW wages (#1109) — the county total and each sector gain
#   `avg_annual_pay` (USD/year) and `avg_weekly_wage` (USD/week) `ProvenancedValue`s (already in the
#   fetched CSV, previously dropped). Optional/backward-compatible: a suppressed or zero-wage slice
#   omits the field rather than asserting a fabricated $0.
# 1.16.0: adds the `energy-burden` object feed (#1110) — median household income (Census B19013)
#   with derived electricity / gas / combined household energy burden (% of income), a fully
#   `[derived]` consumer-impact metric alongside `consumer-energy`. Present only where the site's
#   committed baseline carries income; absent (section degrades) otherwise.
# 1.17.0: the manifest gains the `readiness` block (#1220/#1222) — the standing domain-activation
#   readiness (`SiteReadiness`): the five domains' `absent|seeded|live` states plus the derived
#   `tier` (`stub|backdrop|case|reference`), recomputed at every export from feed counts + the
#   profile (watermark.site.readiness). The frontend reads it instead of re-deriving section gating.
# 1.18.0: adds the air-quality & backup-generation dispatch feeds (epic #1172, #1181) —
#   `air-scenarios` (Tier-0 emissions scenarios + synthetic-minor NSR cap check, #1177) and
#   `air-dispersion` (Tier-1 AERMOD concentration screen vs NAAQS, event-anchored, #1182).
#   Dispersion is facility+permit-gated (absent → section locks); dispersion runs carry
#   `available=False` when the AERMOD binary/met is absent (deck + NAAQS basis real, no
#   fabricated concentration). Both reuse the domain models (watermark.air), like hydrology-scenarios.
# 1.19.0: adds the `air-dispersion-field` collection feed (epic #1237 / #1232) — the gridded AERMOD
#   concentration surface per pollutant (`DispersionField`) the deck.gl FieldLayer renders: the
#   receptor grid reshaped into per-averaging-period `values[]`, the model-grid→lon/lat `geo_ref`
#   corner box, per-period NAAQS lines, and a fixed `provenance: assumption` marker (the CBI-redacted
#   stack ⇒ [inference]). Reference-site gated; `available=False` with empty `values` when the AERMOD
#   binary/met is absent (geometry real, no fabricated concentration).
# 1.20.0: adds the `reach-network` object feed (epic #1237 / #1235) — the real river-centerline
#   geometry (`ReachNetwork`) the deck.gl FlowLayer particle-advection viz advects over: one
#   downstream-oriented `ReachLine` (lon/lat polyline) per model reach node, keyed by `node_id`
#   so the frontend joins flow magnitude (routed-hydrograph) + deficit (hydrology-scenarios) by
#   node. Geometry is verbatim NHDPlus via USGS NLDI (watermark.hydrology.reach_geometry),
#   committed under data/reference/hydrology/reaches/. Reference-site gated like routed-hydrograph;
#   absent when the committed centerline file is missing (nothing invented).
# 1.21.0: adds the `greenops` object feed (#1076/#1084) — Watermark's own compute footprint
#   (`GreenopsReport`): the usage → electricity → water derivation, with headline stats,
#   compute-by-function / AI-by-task / monthly-electricity / water breakdowns, and a methodology
#   block, every figure a `ProvenancedValue` tagged reference/derived/assumption (never verified —
#   our own consumption is modeled, not metered). Global like `network`: emitted into every
#   bundle identically from the committed data/reference/greenops/footprint.yaml (a modeled
#   placeholder when that artifact is absent, so the feed is never skipped).
# 1.22.0: adds the `water-seasonal-field` object feed (epic #1237 / #1236) — the seasonal
#   evaporation / net-atmospheric-withdrawal climograph the deck.gl FieldLayer renders as a
#   cartesian month-axis strip (Phase 2, water). The field scalar is net atmospheric withdrawal
#   (reference ET0 - precip, mm/day, from the cited NASA POWER normals + FAO-56 ET0); the deficit
#   boundary (net=0) is the threshold isopleth. The per-month low-flow `multiple` rides along for
#   the SSR table/probe and is [inference] (it screens the modeled buildout draw). Reference-site
#   gated; `available=False` with empty `months` when the climate/scenario inputs are absent.
# 1.23.0: adds an optional quantitative range to `ProvenancedValue` (#760) — `low`/`high`
#   absolute bounds around the central `value`, distinct from the qualitative `confidence`.
#   A measured/derived estimate whose honest representation is a band ("226 ± ~35 ac") now
#   carries the spread as data rather than prose in the citation, so the bundle/frontend and
#   the uncertainty engine (#271) consume it uniformly. Both bounds optional (a document-
#   verbatim figure stays a single value); back-compatible — every feed embedding a
#   `ProvenancedValue` gains the two nullable fields.
# 1.24.0: adds the `contacts` collection feed — the curated per-site directory of human contact
#   points (petitioners, organizers, officials, community groups, outlets) a reader can reach.
#   Slug-scoped committed YAML (`data/site/contacts.yaml`, sibling reads its own `<slug>/`),
#   modeled like `leads` (#796): every contact names a real `source` (no fabricated people, per
#   the data-discipline rules) and carries only *public* routing (`links`) — private hand-off
#   addresses stay server-side. The spine the petition-connect + bulletin surfaces reference;
#   absent → the feed is skipped and the section degrades. Back-compatible (additive feed +
#   the `contact` catalog kind).
# 1.25.0: adds the `facts` collection feed — the normalized `(subject, predicate, value, unit,
#   status, evidence)` projection over the bundle's already-provenanced numeric facts (#1587,
#   epic #1579 Phase 3). A `catalog-index`-style post-pass (`watermark.site.facts`): it mints no
#   values and copies no payloads, it re-keys each `ProvenancedValue` already in the economics /
#   greenops / hydrology / air feeds (plus the derived facility `PowerBasis`) into one flat,
#   queryable table so a fact question is a tiny retrieval + arithmetic, not a whole-record pull.
#   `status` is the evidence-discipline tag derived from each value's `source_kind`
#   (`watermark.provenance.evidence_tag`: document/connector→verified, reference→reference,
#   assumption/derived→inference; `open` is reserved for unquantified facts). `evidence` reuses
#   the shared provenance shape but `page` stays null where the source `ProvenancedValue` carries
#   none — never invented (chain of custody). Powers the `get_facts` MCP tool. `rsei`/`records`
#   projection + `aggregate_facts` (#1588) are deferred follow-ups. Back-compatible (an additive
#   collection feed; registered in the `catalog` like any dataset, no new catalog-index kind).
# 1.26.0: adds the `passages` collection feed + its `passage-embeddings` companion — the page-level
#   excerpt index the `search_passages` MCP tool returns instead of a whole extracted record (#1589,
#   epic #1579 Phase 3). `passages` carries one `PassageItem` per text-bearing page of a *published*
#   source PDF (scoped to the default-deny publish allowlist #280, so no non-published source text
#   ships): `document_id` joins to the `documents` feed / `get_document` by `DocumentItem.rel`, `page`
#   is the 1-indexed printed page, `text` is the pypdf text-layer extraction verbatim (garbled OCR for
#   scans — a locator, never a transcription; image-only pages are omitted). `passage-embeddings` is
#   the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 vector companion (the same 384-dim space as `ask-embeddings`) for the hybrid
#   BM25+vector search; like `ask-embeddings` both feeds are always emitted (empty when the source PDFs
#   are absent / `--no-embeddings`) so the schema set stays stable. Not cataloged (a retrieval index,
#   like `ask-embeddings`). Back-compatible (two additive feeds, no changed shapes).
# 1.27.0: adds the `open-questions` collection feed (#1568, epic #1560 workstream B) — the aggregated
#   still-open threads of the corpus, each with provenance. A post-pass projection
#   (`watermark.site.open_questions`) over the just-assembled `leads` + `hypothesis-assessments` feeds:
#   every `[open]`-tagged lead (wired to the `lead:kind:question` / `lead:status:unanswered` label
#   vocabulary) + every `[open]`-tagged hypothesis cell, ported from yidam's `open-questions` model
#   (open ⇔ the `[open]` tag). Skipped for a site with no open threads, so `hasFeed("open-questions")`
#   is false and the section degrades rather than shipping an empty list. Not cataloged (a derived
#   view — the underlying leads are already cataloged). Back-compatible (one additive feed).
# 1.27.1: `DocumentItem` gains optional version/duplicate-cluster metadata — `duplicate_cluster`,
#   `canonical_document_id`, `version`, `supersedes` (#1590, epic #1579 Phase 3), projected from the
#   curated custody manifest (`data/site/document-versions.yaml`) by watermark.site.docversions so
#   retrieval can collapse a filing's versions to the canonical one while retaining a superseded
#   version's distinct evidence (`deduplicate` / `version_policy` args on search_corpus/passages).
#   Additive/optional — absent for a document with no declared cluster (PATCH, back-compatible).
# 1.28.0: adds the `corpus-index` collection feed (#1573, epic #1560 workstream C) — the at-a-glance
#   map of the yidam corpus mirror, one `CorpusNodeItem` per projected node with its display `kind`,
#   in/out degree, line count, and freshness (last commit of the committed source it derives from).
#   A post-pass over the just-built `Mirror` (`watermark.site.corpus_index`): `links_in`/`links_out`
#   are the resolved edge counts, `lines` replicates `write_mirror`'s serialization for parity with
#   `yidam corpus-index`, and `updated` is the newest git commit date over the node's backing corpus
#   file(s) (null when a node is aggregated/code-derived — never fabricated). Always emitted (every
#   site's mirror has ≥1 node), so the schema set stays stable. Not cataloged (a derived view of the
#   corpus, like `open-questions`). Back-compatible (one additive feed).
# 1.29.0: the manifest gains an optional `exports` block (#1574, epic #1560 workstream D1) — the
#   graph exports (RDF Turtle + JSON-LD, GraphML) of the corpus mirror (#1561), rendered by
#   `watermark.site.graph_exports` and written under the bundle's `exports/` as downloadable
#   research artifacts (the wiki graph page links them). Each `ExportRef` names a file, its media
#   type, format, and node/edge counts. Additive/optional — absent when the mirror wasn't
#   projected for this bundle (a redirected/test export); the frontend degrades to no downloads
#   (one additive manifest field, no changed feed shapes, back-compatible).
# 1.30.0: adds the `corpus-nodes` retrieval feed (#1575, epic #1560 workstream D2) — the searchable
#   substrate behind the wiki "ask this concept" affordance. A second post-pass over the same
#   `Mirror` the `corpus-index` map is built from (`watermark.site.corpus_nodes`), but carrying each
#   node's *searchable text* (`text`, the one canonical `node_text` the semantic index also embeds,
#   so the lexical and vector surfaces tokenize the same content), its evidence tag when it bears one
#   (`evidence`), its page key (`ref`, a concept slug today), and its undirected 1-hop adjacency
#   (`neighbors`) so the frontend can scope client-side lexical retrieval to one concept's corpus
#   neighborhood — no server, offline. Always emitted (the mirror is never empty), so the schema set
#   stays stable. Not cataloged (a derived retrieval index, like `corpus-index`/`open-questions`).
#   Back-compatible (one additive feed).
# 1.30.1: the `rsei` feed (the `RseiInventory` model) gains a per-facility `top_water_chemicals`
#   array — each facility's cumulative pounds released *to water* by chemical (the media-3 breakdown,
#   reconciling to `pounds_by_media["water"]`), the input the chemical-specific toxic screen reads
#   (WS-07 / #1607). Additive/optional (absent facilities default to `[]`), so an existing rsei.json
#   without it stays valid — PATCH, back-compatible.
# 1.30.2: each `hydrology-scenarios` `AssimilativeCheck` gains `effluent_credited_ratio` +
#   `effluent_credited_flag`, and its long-reserved `upstream_returns` field is now *computed*
#   (WS-15 / #1615): the permitted effluent already in the reach (Σ other WWTPs sharing the
#   receiving water) credited into a second, effluent-credited dilution ratio, presented alongside
#   the conservative cited-7Q10-only `dilution_ratio` (unchanged). Additive/optional (all three are
#   null when a plant is alone on its stream), so an existing feed row stays valid — PATCH,
#   back-compatible.
# 1.30.3: each `routed-hydrograph` reach (the `ReachRouting` model) gains `subreaches` + `courant`
#   — the sub-reach discretization the Muskingum-Cunge routing ran at (WS-09 / #1609): the reach is
#   split into `subreaches` Courant≈1 steps routed in series (curing the coarse-single-step
#   coefficient blow-up the old output clamp masked), and `courant` (c·Δt/Δx, ≈ 1) is the routing
#   validity flag. Additive with defaults (`subreaches=1`, `courant=0.0`), so an existing
#   routed-hydrograph.json without them stays valid — PATCH, back-compatible.
# 1.31.0: adds the `facility` collection feed (#1628, epic #1626 F2) — the machine-readable
#   projection of the now multi-facility `SiteProfile.facilities`: one `FacilityItem` per disclosed
#   campus carrying its lifecycle `status`, structured `operator` / `end_use`, IT-load bracket,
#   site-plan disclosure, cooling archetype, and resolved geometry link. The manifest gains an
#   optional `facility` summary block (`FacilitySummary`: the primary campus's status + the facility
#   count) the frontend reads for the per-site status badge (retiring the hardcoded TS
#   `FACILITY_STATUS` dict), and the `network` feed's `NodeActivity` gains `facility_status` /
#   `operator` / `end_use` / `facility_count`. Facility-gated (feed skipped, block absent for a
#   facility-less site). One new feed → MINOR, back-compatible (the manifest block + activity fields
#   are optional, so a pre-1.31 bundle degrades to `investigation`).
# 1.32.0: the `defense-contractors` feed's `DefenseContractorItem` gains a resolved federal-dollar
#   join (#1662, ME-C): each seed prime carries the USASpending awards its matched corpus entities
#   resolve to (`awards` — `ContractorAward` with `total_obligations`, `nexus`, a defense-vs-civilian
#   `defense_share`, the trailing `annual_obligations` flow, and the top `by_psc` / `by_naics`
#   category mix), plus a rolled-up `total_obligations` scalar + strongest `nexus`. The federal
#   dollars already reached the entity graph; this joins them to the feed that names the contractor.
#   Additive/optional (a contractor with no matched award keeps empty `awards` / null totals), so a
#   pre-1.32 defense-contractors.json stays valid — MINOR, back-compatible.
# 1.32.1: each `hydrology-scenarios` `ScenarioResult` gains three optional provenanced fields
#   (#1633, epic #1626 F7) — `receiving_summer_30q10` + `receiving_1q10` (the cited seasonal design
#   low flows) and `campus_routed_discharge` (the demand node's own routed industrial discharge,
#   Lima's FM-2). They surface figures already grounded in the balance / low-flow table so the
#   frontend dilution model reads them per-site instead of hardcoding Lima's floors + FM-2 constant.
#   All three default null (a scenario without them stays valid) — PATCH, back-compatible.
# 1.33.0: the `economics-baseline` feed is made honest about the federal / military employment the
#   county QCEW cannot see (#1661, ME-B). `IndustryEmployment.latest` gains `government` — the
#   federal/state/local ownership slices (QCEW own 1/2/3, agglvl 71) the private-ownership sector
#   mix structurally cannot show, closing the total-vs-sectors reconciliation (at a federal enclave
#   the federal row is the county's largest employer yet carries no NAICS sector). `EconomicBaseline`
#   gains `unit_caveat` (the county-straddle caveat promoted from prose `note` to a structured field)
#   and `coverage_note` (a standing caveat documenting the excluded uniformed active-duty military).
#   All additive/optional (government defaults `[]`, unit_caveat null, coverage_note a model default),
#   so a pre-1.33 economics-baseline.json stays valid — MINOR, back-compatible.
# 1.33.1: each `hydrology-scenarios` `AssimilativeCheck` gains the acute pair `acute_low_flow` +
#   `acute_dilution_ratio` + `acute_flag` (WS-08 / #1608). The screen matches the design flow to
#   the criterion type — chronic aquatic-life dilution at the cited 7Q10 (`dilution_ratio`,
#   unchanged) and **acute** at the cited **1Q10** — because banding an acute limit with the
#   chronic design flow understates the constraint (a standard reviewer objection). All three are
#   null when the fact sheet omits the 1Q10; a cited 1Q10 = 0 cfs (a stream that runs dry at design
#   low flow) yields a 0:1 acute ratio (no acute capacity). Additive/optional, so an existing
#   hydrology-scenarios.json row stays valid — PATCH, back-compatible.
# 1.34.0: the `records` feed's closed RecordGroup enum gains two genres (#1746, epic #1744;
#   fulfills the Findlay TAXONOMY-GRANTS lead): `enforcement` (an `order` payload block —
#   consent decrees, OEPA Director's Final Findings & Orders, closure/extension letters) and
#   `finance` (an `award` block — WPCLF/OWDA loans, principal-forgiveness awards, federal
#   grants). Until now these genres had no honest bucket and were filed under `permits-epa`
#   with a disclosed TAXONOMY NOTE. Enum growth is additive for feed READERS (a pre-1.34
#   records.json remains valid) but a pre-1.34 records.schema.json rejects the new group
#   values — MINOR, back-compatible for data, schema refresh required.
# 1.35.0: adds the `grid` object feed (#1642, GP-E E1) — the per-site **grid backdrop**
#   (`watermark.grid.model.GridProfile`): the cited electric-service chain (serving utility,
#   holding company, balancing authority, wholesale RTO, retail regulator — each a `CitedFact`),
#   the EIA-861 utility annual profile (retail sales / customers / average price), the EIA-930
#   balancing-authority annual load, and, where a campus is disclosed, the `load_share` block
#   expressing its draw as a share of the utility / BA / state denominators. This was the richest
#   per-site grid artifact in the repo and it reached only a CLI-produced reference file
#   (`SiteProfile.grid_relpath`), never the bundle — so the presentation tier had no feed carrying
#   the grid backdrop and filled the vacuum with hand-copied Lima constants (`gridLoad.ts`'s
#   `AEP_OHIO_RETAIL_GWH` / `OHIO_RETAIL_GWH`), a second uncontrolled copy of the EIA
#   denominators. Grid identity joins the **backdrop floor** (`watermark.site.readiness`): it
#   describes the *place*, not the campus, so a facility-less peer carries it with `load_share`
#   null rather than nothing at all. Exported as its own already-provenanced Pydantic model like
#   `rsei` / `economics-baseline` (`ProvenancedValue` + `CitedFact` carry the #60 discipline), so
#   no new model is defined here. One new feed → MINOR, back-compatible (a reader that doesn't
#   know `grid` is unaffected; a pre-1.35 bundle simply has no grid backdrop to render).
# 1.36.0: the `defense-contractors` feed carries its evidence discipline in the type system
#   instead of in prose (#1663, ME-D). `DefenseContractorItem` gains `tag` + `tag_basis` — the
#   register of the item's corridor-presence claim (`open` when nothing matched, `inference` for a
#   bare owner/party name-pattern hit, `verified` only when a UEI-pinned award's curated `nexus`
#   corroborates it), retiring the page's "leads, not verdicts" callout as the *only* carrier of
#   that caveat. `ScanParcel` gains the pair the old scan conflated: `record_tag` for the GIS
#   columns themselves (verbatim from the county service → `verified`) and
#   `attribution` / `attribution_tag` / `attribution_basis` for what the scan claims the parcel IS
#   — at Lima, the `[inference]` JSMC identification that previously existed only as a free-text
#   prefix inside `meta.army_controlled_note`. The attribution text + register are sourced from the
#   site profile's `GisDefenseMeta` (never parsed out of the note), so a peer states its own.
#   All six fields carry defaults, so a pre-1.36 defense-contractors.json stays valid — MINOR,
#   back-compatible.
# 1.37.0: adds the `drawdown` object feed (groundwater well-drawdown thread) — the reference
#   site's Theis cone-of-depression screen (`watermark.hydrology.drawdown.DrawdownResult`) over the
#   ODNR well-log census + the literature aquifer parameters. Carries the `[inference]` apex
#   drawdown (a transmissivity-bracketed `ProvenancedValue`), the radius of influence, the count of
#   domestic census wells within it, the cone profile for the AquiferSection figure, and the
#   hypothetical-pumping scenario + caveats. Its headline is the inverse finding: a hyperscale
#   groundwater stress DEWATERS the low-transmissivity limestone aquifer — corroborating the
#   campus's reliance on municipal surface water. Reference-gated by construction (only a site with
#   a committed well-log census + a resolvable cooling basis produces it; `load_drawdown` returns
#   `None` otherwise → feed skipped), and exported as its own already-provenanced model like `grid`
#   / `rsei`, so no new model is defined here. One new feed → MINOR, back-compatible (a reader that
#   doesn't know `drawdown` is unaffected; a pre-1.37 bundle simply has no cone to render).
# 1.38.0: adds the `dewatering` object feed + the `geo/dewatering` map layer — the DOCUMENTED peer
#   of `drawdown`. Where `drawdown` screens a single HYPOTHETICAL cooling-makeup well, `dewatering`
#   models the real, documented wellfield the developer installed to lower the water table for site
#   grading (`watermark.hydrology.dewatering.DewateringImpact`): 44 [verified] ODNR well-log/sealing
#   records as a superposition of Cooper-Jacob cones, evaluated at each nearby domestic census well.
#   Carries the per-well cones (transmissivity-bracketed T + radius of influence), the domestic
#   census wells inside the composite cone with their [inference] superimposed drawdown, the field
#   capacity / operating window / `as_of` snapshot date, and caveats. The wells/rates/dates are
#   [verified]; every drawdown is [inference], bracketed. The `geo/dewatering` layer projects the
#   same wellfield onto the deck.gl map (well points sized by radius of influence + the impacted
#   domestic wells), reusing the shared `geo.schema.json`. Site-gated by construction (only a site
#   with a committed `SiteProfile.dewatering_wellfield_relpath` produces them; both self-skip
#   elsewhere), and the object feed is exported as its own already-provenanced model like `grid` /
#   `drawdown`, so no new model is defined here. One object feed + one geo layer → MINOR,
#   back-compatible (a pre-1.38 bundle simply has no wellfield to render).
# 1.39.0: the `dewatering` feed gains two optional fields answering "where did the pumped water go?"
#   — `discharge_screen` and `reservoir_recharge` (`watermark.hydrology.dewatering_discharge`). The
#   discharge screen compares the USGS reach gain between the bracketing gages (Ottawa @ Lima 128 sq
#   mi → near Kalida 350 sq mi) over the documented pumping window vs. a prior-year baseline,
#   restricted to baseflow days, against the expected ~7.6 cfs discharge — its honest headline a
#   NEGATIVE result (`outcome: not_separable`): the signal is swamped by the 222 sq mi of incremental
#   drainage, and the upstream low-flow floor is unchanged, so the surface record can neither confirm
#   nor exclude the discharge (the NPDES authorization is the `[open]` owed record). The reservoir
#   read characterizes the Auglaize supply gage's recharge conditions over the same window. Gage
#   discharge is `[verified]` USGS daily values; every attribution is `[inference]`. Both are read
#   from the committed `dewatering-discharge.yaml` report (regenerated by `watermark
#   dewatering-discharge --write`), so the export stays offline/deterministic. Two additive optional
#   fields on an existing model → MINOR, back-compatible (a pre-1.39 bundle carries a cone with no
#   discharge screen; a reader that doesn't know the fields is unaffected).
# 1.40.0: the `dewatering` feed's impacted wells become vulnerability-aware + directional (the "why
#   does a shallow dry well slip past us?" thread). Each `ImpactedWell` gains `available_column_ft`
#   (the well's own buffer before going dry = total depth - static level), `column_consumed_frac`,
#   and `goes_dry` — because a very shallow well is dewatered by a decline a deep one shrugs off, so
#   the flat >1 ft threshold under- and over-states real risk; the screen now also admits a well the
#   drawdown would push past its OWN column even below 1 ft. And `DewateringImpact` gains a
#   `hydraulic_gradient` (regional water-table gradient fit from census head `dem_elev - static`) +
#   a per-well `gradient_position` (up/down/cross-gradient) — the groundwater analog of the discharge
#   screen's upstream/downstream, since a radial cone is direction-blind but a down-gradient well sees
#   the field ~upstream of it. All `[inference]`. Additive optional fields on an existing model →
#   MINOR, back-compatible (a pre-1.40 reader is unaffected).
# 1.41.0: adds the `thermal` object feed (#1719, epic #1715 Phase 4) — the receiving-water
#   temperature-rise / CWA §316(a) screen (`watermark.hydrology.thermal.ThermalDischargeInventory`),
#   the **third cooling axis**. The platform already published cooling *volume*
#   (`hydrology-scenarios`) and discharge *chemistry* (the toxics screen); the discharge's *heat*
#   reached only a committed reference file. Each row is one facility's heat load read against the
#   reach's Ohio numeric temperature criterion (OAC 3745-1-35 Table 35-11, by geographic zone) at
#   the cited design low flows: the fully-mixed ΔT and mixed temperature, the reach's thermal
#   assimilative capacity, the Great Lakes RIS tolerances the mixed temperature crosses, and the
#   OAC 3745-1-06 (O)(5) closed-cycle-blowdown exemption. Rows carry `kind` — a `data_center` row's
#   heat load is MODELLED from the disclosed IT load (`[inference]`, with its three heat-partition
#   `scenarios` and the derived-vs-observed `calibration`), a `permitted_discharger` row's is the
#   permittee's own ECHO-DMR reported effluent temperature x flow (`[verified]`, with the `dmr`
#   block naming the permit's numeric limit or its absence). Never conflate them: read `kind`
#   before quoting a number. Site-gated by the artifact's own `meta.site`, so a peer cannot inherit
#   the reference site's corridor; exported as its own already-provenanced model like `grid` /
#   `drawdown` / `dewatering`, so no new model is defined here. One new feed → MINOR,
#   back-compatible (a pre-1.41 bundle simply has no thermal screen to render).
# 1.42.0: the federal-enclave seam (#1664, epic #1659 ME-E) — two new feeds and one additive
#   field. `enclave` (object) publishes a federal installation's OWN land / water / wastewater /
#   power / toxics: the DoD MIRTA boundary measured against the acreage its grounding record
#   states, its EPA SDWIS community water systems, its EPA ECHO NPDES discharges, an `[open]`
#   electrical load, and — the point of the cluster — its own EPA RSEI/TRI row together with the
#   plain statement of why the site's county backdrop cannot contain it (a straddling enclave
#   reports TRI from the county the profile did NOT pick as its economic unit) and why even that
#   row cannot carry the CERCLA mass. `geo/enclave` publishes the boundary as a map layer and is
#   the second geometry signal the `places` domain activates on, so a site that will never have a
#   county CAMA parcel is no longer structurally locked out of the domain. `FacilityItem` gains
#   `kind` (`data_center` | `federal_installation`, defaulting to the former, so every existing
#   row is unchanged) — a consumer must branch on it rather than read a `federal_installation`'s
#   absent IT load as an undisclosed campus MW. Two new feeds + an optional field → MINOR,
#   back-compatible (a pre-1.42 bundle simply has no enclave to render).
# 1.43.0: the economic argument as disciplined scenario bands (#1665, epic #1659 ME-F) — one
#   new feed. `economics-scenarios` (object) publishes what lived only in prose and in a
#   hardcoded frontend array: the discrete what-if `profiles` (building share x jobs, each
#   priced for forgone property tax / un-abated tax kept / sales-tax exemption / net subsidy /
#   per-job), the ledger `lines` as bands over those corners, the `load_per_job` ratio (the
#   §3 "subsidizes load, not employment" magnitude), the `withheld` inputs that keep the bands
#   wide with the record that would collapse each, the modeling `constants` as cited
#   `ProvenancedValue`s, and the cited industry `axes` (the GovCloud authorized-region premium,
#   the DCTE / AI-rack refresh curve, jobs-per-MW, the subsidy-per-job benchmark) each carrying
#   every published source pooled into it. The DISCIPLINE is in the type system, not the prose:
#   a band refuses `low == high`, and every axis / line / withheld input refuses the `verified`
#   tag and any confidence above `low` — a scenario structurally cannot serialize as an
#   assertion, and the GovCloud profile is a labeled counterfactual, explicitly not a defense
#   finding. INSTRUMENT-gated on `SiteProfile.abatement_parameters_relpath`, so a peer with no
#   abatement agreement on the record simply has no feed and its report locks rather than being
#   priced off another county's mills. One new feed → MINOR, back-compatible (a pre-1.43 bundle
#   simply has no scenario bands to render).
# 1.44.0: the impact study as a typed bundle artifact (#1804, epic #1803 P1) — one new feed.
#   `impact-study` (collection) ships the missing-impact-study's data spine: one row per study
#   chapter, keyed `(chapter, facility_key)`, each carrying the chapter's verdict
#   (`data | partial | gap | na` — row counts + content probes, never presence alone), its
#   headline `stats` (each wearing a `verified | inference | open` evidence tag), its gap
#   findings (the fixed three-line grammar: the requirement, the absence, the ask), the
#   MUST-render caveats, and the strictly-curated `lead_ids` joins onto the site's own leads
#   board. A pure post-pass PROJECTION over the feeds already assembled (`watermark.site.
#   impact_study`, the `open-questions` pattern): it mints no claims and reads no corpus —
#   the same sources the frontend's TS composers read, which it replaces row-for-row (the
#   frontend prefers a shipped row wholesale; a parity suite over every committed bundle
#   pins the two derivations equal, so the cutover cannot silently change a published
#   verdict). Emitted for every site — a facility-less site's project-dependent chapters
#   read `na` (watch state), never `gap`. One new feed → MINOR, back-compatible (a pre-1.44
#   bundle simply composes chapter models at the frontend build instead).
# 1.45.0: the cooling-cycling reconciliation reaches the bundle (#1805, epic #1803 P2) — one
#   new feed. `cooling-reconciliation` (object) ships THE SITE'S OWN candidate row(s) of the
#   committed claim-vs-record water account (`data/reference/oepa/cooling-reconciliation.yaml`,
#   epic #1676: the A3 harness, the A4 secondary corroborators, the B1-B3 provenance slots) —
#   claim (archetype + source + citation), the predicted account at screening grade, the
#   documented / reserved / disclosed slots kept structurally distinct, outcome
#   (`discrepancy | corroborated | reservation_conflict | gap`) + tag + finding, the
#   records-sought lead, and the corroborator stances — validated back through the producer's
#   own `ReconciliationRecord` model and shipped verbatim, so the feed is byte-consistent with
#   the reference artifact by construction. The harness's discipline rules ride the feed as
#   MUST-render `caveats` (a ceiling is not an instrument; a self-report never upgrades the
#   source; corroborators never change the outcome; a back-solved CoC is a bracket). Site-gated
#   on the rows' own `site` key and self-skipped when the site has no row (#1364), and the
#   Intel positive-control row (`is_control`) is excluded explicitly — a calibration vector
#   never ships as site data, even on a `new-albany` bundle. One new feed → MINOR,
#   back-compatible (a pre-1.45 bundle simply renders the water chapter without the
#   reconciliation block).
# 1.45.1: `FacilityItem` gains the disclosed backup-generation columns (#1771) —
#   `genset_count` / `genset_mw` / `genset_rating_basis` and the CITED total
#   (`genset_total_mw` + `genset_total_approximate` + `genset_total_citation`). They are
#   disclosed campus data that belonged in the facility inventory regardless; the immediate
#   consumer is `gridLoad.ts`, which carried Lima's 313 MW / 114 gensets / 2,750 ekW as TS
#   literals duplicating `SiteFacility.genset_*` with nothing pinning the copies together. The
#   total ships as the record's own `~313 MW` rather than the components' 313.5 product, and
#   the rating basis (`draft_only` for Lima's CBI-redacted rating, `derived` for Fort Wayne's
#   heat-input back-derivation) is what lets a consumer grade the figure without parsing permit
#   prose. Additive + optional → PATCH; a pre-1.45.1 bundle just carries no genset columns.
# 1.46.0: the `records` feed's closed RecordGroup enum gains the two genres Urbana's corpus
#   carries (#1724): `litigation` (a `case:` block — a filed court instrument's structured read:
#   caption, court, docket, the parties, counts and relief pleaded) and `land-assembly` (a
#   `conveyances:` list — a recorded transfer chain, one entry per deed, sourced to a county
#   CAMA layer). Both are whole-document payloads, and `land-assembly` is kept distinct from
#   `deeds` on purpose: that group is instrument-level, a per-deed read of a recorder PDF, while
#   a register is a compiled chain. Until now neither genre had a bucket, so a site whose worked
#   corpus was a complaint plus a land register published an EMPTY records feed and read
#   `record: seeded` over real extractions. Enum growth is additive for feed READERS (a pre-1.46
#   records.json stays valid) but a pre-1.46 records.schema.json rejects the new group values —
#   MINOR, back-compatible for data, schema refresh required.
# 1.47.0: the `records` feed's closed RecordGroup enum gains `labor` — a statutorily required
#   notice of a plant closing or mass layoff, filed with a state workforce agency (Ohio's WARN
#   Act / the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988). Findlay's
#   corpus carries two (#1460: Goodyear's Tall Timbers Mold closure, Michigan Sugar's warehouse),
#   and no existing group fits one: it is not a permit, not an enforcement order, not an award,
#   not a deed, and not a pleading. Filing it under the nearest bucket would present a workforce
#   instrument as an environmental one, which is the misfiling this enum exists to prevent. Its
#   payload key is `layoff_notice:` and NOT the already-taken `notice:`, which belongs to the
#   R.C. 1311.04 Notice of Commencement extractions in `recorder/` and `legal/` — those are
#   deliberately left unclaimed here so this bump can't silently reclassify them. Enum growth is
#   additive for feed READERS (a pre-1.47 records.json stays valid) but a pre-1.47
#   records.schema.json rejects the new group value — MINOR, back-compatible for data, schema
#   refresh required.
# 1.48.0: the shared `Citation` gains `pages` — the whole 1-based span a claim was read from —
#   and the `records` builder finally populates the `page` that has been null on every record
#   the bundle has ever shipped (#1584). It had the page all along: `DocExtraction.pages_read`
#   carries the 0-based indices, and the builder was formatting them into the prose `note` as
#   `"pages [16, 17]"` — off by one against every other page cite in the bundle, unparseable,
#   and invisible to the field a consumer actually reads. `page` is now the first page and
#   `pages` the span, both 1-based; `pages` is null for a single-page read and stays a LIST
#   because a read is often non-contiguous (one Lima permit record cites pages 1-4, 37, 40,
#   84-85, 93). The immediate consumer is the public MCP server, which now returns a structured
#   `citation` object on every result instead of burying provenance in prose. `Citation` is
#   `extra="forbid"`, so this refreshes every schema that embeds it (records, timeline,
#   meetings, places, people, catalog, exhibits, …) — MINOR, back-compatible for data, schema
#   refresh required.
# 1.49.0: the `greenops` feed reports carbon, counts inference, and says which of its numbers
#   are real (#1643, epic #1637 GP-F). Four additive shapes on `GreenopsReport`:
#   * `carbon` (`CarbonAccount`) — a first-class CO2e figure plus a fifth `headline` entry.
#     eGRID's whole purpose is this number and the page reported every dimension except it;
#     the factor was used only to build a prose sentence. Dual-reported per the GHG Protocol:
#     our derived **location-based** total (electricity x the subregion's output rate, each
#     fleet priced at its OWN subregion) alongside AWS's own location-based *and* market-based
#     estimates, which were read from the export and never surfaced. A market-based figure
#     prices contracted procurement, not the physical grid — published beside, never instead.
#   * `energy` (`EnergyBreakdown`) — electricity split infrastructure vs **model inference**.
#     Inference was scoped out entirely: tokens converted only to a display call count, no
#     Wh/token coefficient anywhere, so the electricity/carbon/water headlines structurally
#     could not represent a Claude-driven platform. It is now priced per 1,000 OUTPUT tokens
#     by model class against a new committed factor table (decode dominates; applying an
#     output-basis coefficient to an input+output total would overstate a cache-heavy agentic
#     workload several-fold) and folded into the same chain everything downstream reads.
#   * `basis` (`illustrative | measured`), on the report and on each source export — stamped
#     from the connector's fetch path, never by hand. The committed exports are fixture-derived
#     samples and now say so, in the feed and on the page, instead of round placeholder
#     magnitudes reading as a measured footprint.
#   * `low`/`high` on the derived figures. Every coefficient (W/vCPU, PUE, the WUE rows, the
#     new per-token ones) carries a dated citation and a band, propagated through the chain —
#     the published spread runs to an order of magnitude and was previously invisible.
#   `WueBenchmark.basis` also gains a third value, `upstream`: the generation increment is a
#   term you ADD to a site WUE, not a WUE of its own, and typing it as `source` is what let the
#   water headline sum two bases the model's own docstring forbade summing. Water is now
#   tenant-attributed (we operate no data center — it is the provider's cooling, apportioned by
#   billed IT-kWh, with PUE divided back out of a per-IT-kWh benchmark). All four report fields
#   are optional/defaulted, so a pre-1.49 greenops.json stays valid; a pre-1.49
#   greenops.schema.json rejects the new keys — MINOR, back-compatible for data, schema refresh
#   required.
# 1.50.0: the `cooling-reconciliation` feed learns that an instrument can be BLIND, and that a
#   prediction can be refused (#1686, epic #1676 B6 — the New Albany / Intel positive control).
#   The harness's two record sources are jurisdictional, not universal: the withdrawal registry
#   meters withdrawals from waters of the state, and the NPDES record covers discharges to them.
#   A campus that BUYS its water from a municipal system and sends its wastewater to a POTW
#   sanitary sewer is outside both — so both return ~0 for it by construction, and the
#   classifier was reading that ~0 as "documented ≈ 0 → corroborated dry". Four additive shapes
#   on `CoolingWaterAccount` + one new outcome:
#   * `route` (`CoolingWaterRoute`) — the cited supply/discharge determination that says whether
#     the instruments reach this facility at all. Set only where the record establishes it.
#   * a fifth `ReconcileOutcome`, **`route_blind`** — the negative read is invalidated (a ~0 from
#     a blind instrument never corroborates a claim) while a POSITIVE signal still adjudicates,
#     so `discrepancy` / `reservation_conflict` / a genuinely-corroborated wet claim are
#     unchanged. The pin is kept and the records request is re-aimed at the City-held meter.
#   * `nonprocess_makeup` — a documented, metered withdrawal that IS on record but is NOT the
#     cooling account (Intel's construction-phase groundwater: 0.0435 MGD, ~89% returned,
#     peaking in May while July-August are the year's lowest). A fifth register, never folded
#     into `documented_*`.
#   * `prediction_refused`, and `it_load` / `predicted_makeup` / `predicted_consumptive` /
#     `predicted_blowdown` become **nullable**. Every archetype in `cooling_models` is
#     IT-load-parameterized, so a facility with no IT load — a semiconductor fab, cooled by
#     process heat rather than servers — has no derivable account, and emitting one would
#     fabricate. The four move together with the reason; a renderer shows the refusal and never
#     substitutes a zero.
#   The artifact's meta also gains a `reference_band` (per-IT-MW evaporative makeup / consumptive
#   / blowdown / CoC), archetype-derived and explicitly NOT read off the fab that was supposed to
#   ground it. Existing rows are unchanged and stay valid; a pre-1.50 schema rejects the new keys
#   and a pre-1.50 CONSUMER must handle the nullable predicted side — MINOR, back-compatible for
#   data, schema refresh required.
# 1.51.0: the `cooling-reconciliation` feed learns that a blind instrument still reaches the
#   SUPPLIER (#1684, epic #1676 B4 — Urbana, the origin of the closed-loop framing). One additive
#   shape on `CoolingWaterAccount`:
#   * `supplier_withdrawal` — the reported withdrawal of the municipal SYSTEM that supplies a
#     `route_blind` facility. The registry meters the city, not its customers, so a municipally
#     supplied campus is absent from it while its supplier is fully in it. A sixth register,
#     alongside `documented_*` (metered, this facility), `reserved_*` (a negotiated ceiling),
#     `disclosed_*` (a self-report), and `nonprocess_makeup` (metered, this facility, not the
#     cooling account): it is the SUPPLIER's account, aggregating every customer on the system,
#     so it can never corroborate or contradict one facility's cooling claim. It is carried
#     because it is the DENOMINATOR — Urbana's campus discloses no water figure at all (only the
#     comparison "water use comparable to a standard office building", which is why nothing lands
#     on `disclosed_makeup`), while the City of Urbana reported 1.76 MGD in 2024 and an
#     evaporative read of the same campus at its screening IT load would draw 0.49-1.64 MGD.
#     Valid only alongside a cited municipal supply `route` (a model validator enforces it).
#   Existing rows are unchanged and stay valid; a pre-1.51 schema rejects the new key — MINOR,
#   back-compatible for data, schema refresh required.
# 1.52.0: a hypothesis states its QUESTION (#1917, epic #1911 phase 5). One additive field on
#   `watermark.hypotheses.Hypothesis`, carried straight into the `hypotheses` feed:
#   * `question` — the question the hypothesis exists to answer, in the interrogative. `claim`
#     survives unchanged as the CANDIDATE ANSWER under test and `predicted_evidence` as its
#     answer key; before this the registry held an answer key with no stated question, and every
#     surface presented three assertions where the honest object is three open questions.
#     Required (a hypothesis cannot be constructed without one) and lint-enforced non-empty and
#     interrogative by `watermark hypotheses check`, so a claim cannot creep back into the slot.
#   Existing rows gain a key; a pre-1.52 schema rejects it — MINOR, back-compatible for data,
#   schema refresh required.
# 1.53.0: the `records` feed's closed RecordGroup enum gains `local-legislation` — an act of a
#   LOCAL legislative body, journalled in its own minutes (#1438, epic #1433). Bowling Green's
#   record is the first in the fleet that arrives almost entirely in this form, because the
#   instruments that made that campus are municipal-scale: Wood County Commissioners' Resolution
#   23-01249 authorizing a 75% / 15-year Community Reinvestment Area exemption; the Middleton
#   Township trustees' R.C. 519.12 roll calls rezoning the land, two of them in the SELLERS' names
#   before the buyer's name appears anywhere in that township's record; the Wood County Planning
#   Commission's recommendations one step upstream of each. No existing group fits: `plans` is a
#   plan document, `finance` (`award:`) is a grant or contract award, `deeds` and `land-assembly`
#   are conveyances, and filing a zoning roll call under the nearest of those would present a
#   land-use act as something it is not — the misfiling this enum exists to prevent. The
#   discriminator is deliberately the ACT and not its subject: a rezoning and a tax abatement are
#   the same kind of instrument voted by different boards, so the subject rides in the payload's
#   own `subject_matter` rather than fragmenting the genre. Its payload key is `resolution:`,
#   which nothing in the corpus previously used. Enum growth is additive for feed READERS (a
#   pre-1.53 records.json stays valid) but a pre-1.53 records.schema.json rejects the new group
#   value — MINOR, back-compatible for data, schema refresh required.
# 1.54.0: a `passages` row says which read produced its text (#1966). One additive field on
#   `PassageItem`:
#   * `method` (`PassageMethod`, `pdf_text` | `ocr` | `pdf_text_damaged`, default `pdf_text`) — the
#     embedded text layer, OCR of the rendered page, or a text layer that was broken and could not
#     be re-read. It exists because the text layer is not always merely noisy: two OEPA permits
#     embed subset fonts whose `ToUnicode` CMap maps character codes to raw GLYPH INDICES, and
#     pypdf decodes those runs faithfully into nonsense — `July 1, 2026`, the start date of
#     van-wert's final effluent limitations, extracted as `-XO\` followed by C0 control bytes,
#     every code shifted down by 0x1D. Those control bytes are only the detectable half: codes
#     landing on a printable character shift silently onto other printable characters, so such a
#     page is re-read WHOLE by OCR rather than patched. 50 rows across two documents change read
#     (49 to `ocr`; wilmington's `1MP00060.pdf` p. 127 renders blank, so it degrades to
#     `pdf_text_damaged`); `method` is what lets a consumer see that they did. `text` also gains an
#     invariant that holds for every row and every method: no C0 control byte ever ships.
#   Existing rows gain a key (defaulted, so a pre-1.54 artifact still loads); a pre-1.54
#   passages.schema.json rejects it — MINOR, back-compatible for data, schema refresh required.
# 1.55.0: the study grows the two chapters that read the RECORD (#1969, epic #1968). `impact-study`
#   goes 13 rows to 15 per site — `assembly` (Part I, after `project`) and `governance` (Part III,
#   after `fiscal`). No model changes: same `StudyChapterModel`, two more rows, so a pre-1.55
#   impact-study.schema.json still validates every row.
#   They exist because none of the thirteen keyed on the extracted corpus. `data` came from
#   `method`/`labor`/`missing` (methodology, QCEW baseline, absence register) and `partial` from the
#   facility profile + grid backdrop, so **van-wert (case tier, 6 records) and springfield (backdrop
#   tier, 0 records) shipped identical verdict vectors** — 3 data / 4 partial / 6 gap. A study that
#   cannot tell a worked record from a floor-only pull cannot carry a readiness signal, which is
#   what #1971 needs it to do.
#   Both screen the site's OWN records feed by group — `assembly` on `land-assembly`/`deeds`,
#   `governance` on `local-legislation`/`litigation` (plus `meetings` as an optional status
#   signal) — and NEITHER is `project_dependent`: speculative assembly precedes the announcement
#   (the Lima story), and Mansfield carries a governance record with no facility at all, so a
#   project gate would read the corpus's first documented REFUSAL as "nothing to say here".
#   MINOR, back-compatible: additive rows, no schema refresh.
# 2.0.0: the readiness block's fifth domain is renamed `story` -> `inquiry` and its predicate is
#   replaced (#1971, epic #1968). **MAJOR — this is a breaking rename of a manifest field**, not an
#   additive change: `manifest.readiness.domains.story` is GONE, and a reader keyed on it now hits a
#   missing key rather than a stale value. That is deliberate. A compatibility alias would preserve
#   exactly the thing the epic exists to remove — a domain whose signal is authored prose — under a
#   name that no longer describes it.
#   The old predicate was `slug in STORY_SLUGS and leads > 0`: a hand-maintained Python mirror of a
#   TypeScript overlay of MDX directories, and the ONLY domain whose signal was "did a human write
#   prose." It also gated the tier, so it was the terminal blocker on every site — van-wert read
#   `absent` while carrying three merged investigations, and findlay read `live` for a walk that was
#   `comingSoon` and could not be opened. #1457 proposed flipping fort-wayne to `reference` by
#   committing a leads YAML.
#   `inquiry` reads the site's own `impact-study` verdicts — whether the study ANSWERS — under two
#   conditions: a substantive count (>= 8 of 15 chapters at `data`/`partial`) AND at least one of
#   the two corpus-keyed chapters (`assembly`/`governance`, 1.55.0) substantive. The second is what
#   makes it a record signal: nine of the fifteen chapters derive from connector pulls, the facility
#   profile and the grid backdrop, so a count alone lets a site with zero records out-score a worked
#   corpus.
#   `STORY_SLUGS` is deleted and the `leads` feed is no longer ANDed into any domain — it keeps its
#   own frontend facet signal.
#   The TIER drops to the four record-bearing domains (`backdrop`/`facility`/`places`/`record`);
#   `inquiry` is reported and never gates. On the committed cohort that PROMOTES two sites —
#   fort-wayne and wpafb, both already carrying all four live — and demotes none.
# 2.1.0: the `records` feed's closed RecordGroup enum gains EIGHT genres, closing the gap between
#   the record a site holds and the record a site shows (#1993). `watermark.site.records._classify`
#   recognized 137 of the 263 committed extractions and missed 126; a triage of all 126 against the
#   taxonomy's own rules publishes 32 and excludes 97 (meetings-pipeline machinery, analysis
#   digests, standing watches, derived footprints, custody manifests, documented absences — each
#   verified against the code that consumes it), with the remainder spun out. The eight:
#   * `siting-cases` — a filing in a state utility-siting proceeding for ONE delivery point: an
#     OPSB certificate application or Letter of Notification, a construction notice, a Staff Report
#     of Investigation, or the PJM M-3 need that motivates them. Deliberately OUTSIDE the
#     `permits-*` family and neutral about outcome: an LON under O.A.C. 4906-6-07 is an APPLICATION
#     with a live intervention docket, and a "Permits —" heading would tell a reader a 29-mile
#     345 kV line is permitted when the case is pending.
#   * `tariffs` — a filed retail electric tariff sheet read verbatim at sheet-and-page level (a
#     Schedule DCT, a Rate GT territory definition). It is neither an authorization nor an award:
#     it is the price and the conditions a utility has on file for a class of load.
#   * `agreements` — an executed instrument between a public body and a private party: a mutual
#     NDA, a roadwork development agreement, an intergovernmental wastewater treatment agreement, a
#     statutory Community Reinvestment Area agreement. `finance` (`award:`) is a grant or contract
#     AWARD, and filing a 75%/15-year R.C. 3735.65 exemption there would present an exemption as a
#     grant — the misfiling #1724 refused; `local-legislation` is the ACT that authorized the
#     contract, not the contract.
#   * `incentive-package` — a per-site REGISTER of the incentive and development instruments for
#     one campus: the executed agreements plus the legislative chain that authorized them. Distinct
#     from `agreements` for the same reason `land-assembly` is distinct from `deeds` — a record is
#     one per FILE, and a register cannot honestly be presented as a single executed instrument.
#   * `state-legislation` — a General Assembly bill read section by section against its own printed
#     text. NOT `local-legislation`, whose whole discriminator is that a LOCAL body voted it and
#     journalled it in its own minutes; a statewide bill is a different level of government and, as
#     introduced, is not law at all.
#   * `wetland-determinations` — a USACE Wetland Determination Data Form: a dated field delineation
#     at one sampling point. NOT `permits-epa`, which is an agency ACTION: the form is filled by the
#     APPLICANT'S consultant, and this corpus's own copy records a USACE field scientist disagreeing
#     with its negative finding. The corpus loader keeps `wetlands` separate from `actions` for the
#     same reason.
#   * `statutory-notices` — a notice a party must SERVE or RECORD under a named R.C. section as a
#     precondition to a private act: an R.C. 1311.04 Notice of Commencement, an R.C. 3735.671 /
#     5709.83 notice served on a school district before a tax exemption.
#   * `agency-policy` — an adopted, signed public-records availability and retention policy of a
#     public body, produced in a records request. Dated, adopted and signed, so an instrument — but
#     `plans` is a plan document, `local-legislation` is an act journalled in minutes, and the
#     `permits-*` family is authorizations.
#   Enum growth is additive for feed READERS (a pre-2.1 records.json stays valid) but a pre-2.1
#   records.schema.json rejects the new group values, and `RecordGroup` is ENFORCED — `watermark
#   export` raises for an affected site until the enum lands, so enum, frontend labels, schema
#   regeneration and the committed bundles are one atomic change. MINOR, back-compatible for data,
#   schema refresh required.
# 2.2.0: a `slug-scoped` dataset's `observed` block is THIS SITE's, not the network's aggregate
#   (#2066), and the reference build alone gains `observed_network` — the dataset's membership
#   across the network. MINOR, back-compatible for readers, schema refresh required.
#   `data/catalog/_observed.yaml` keyed observations by dataset id alone, with no site dimension,
#   even for datasets it marked `site_scope: slug-scoped` — which resolve a `{site}`-templated
#   relpath and therefore have a DIFFERENT FILE PER SITE. One aggregate record was rendered into
#   every site's `catalog.json`, where it reads as a fact about that site. For
#   `parcel-assemblage` that record was `file_count: 11 / size_bytes: 531148` — the sum across all
#   eleven sites' files, not any one of them: mansfield's own file is 29,769 bytes, and lima,
#   new-albany and piketon have NO SUCH FILE and still published `exists: true` over half a
#   megabyte of their siblings' bytes. Two sites could also disagree about the same dataset purely
#   by export recency, since the aggregate moves whenever ANY site's copy does.
#   That last property is why the drift check was unusable: `export --check --all` reported
#   "26 of 26 committed bundle(s) drifted" **on a clean tree**, every one of them on
#   `catalog — fields: observed`, so a real regression was indistinguishable from the baseline.
#   `observed` is now the site's own record, and a site with no file of its own resolves to
#   `exists: false` rather than inheriting a sibling's checksum.
#   The aggregate was worth keeping SOMEWHERE — `/about/catalog` is network-global — but not as
#   sha/size/count, which move on every re-pull of any site and would have kept the reference
#   bundle churning. `observed_network` is the membership figure instead (`sites_present` of
#   `sites_total`), which moves only when the SET of sites holding a dataset changes.
# 2.3.0: the `records` feed's closed RecordGroup enum gains `inspections` — a `inspection:` payload
#   block, the agency inspection / compliance-review genre added in #2077 for the 30 Ohio EPA
#   inspection letters on the Lima WWTP. It is deliberately NOT `enforcement`: an inspection
#   IMPOSES NOTHING, and these letters say so in their own words — "The recommendation(s) set out
#   below are not Orders. The recommendations are offered by Ohio EPA in an effort to provide
#   compliance assistance to your facility." Filing them under `enforcement` would publish
#   compliance assistance as an enforceable term, which is the same misfiling the `layoff_notice`
#   and `statutory_notice` keys were named to avoid. The group carries the agency's own
#   `Sig. Non-Compliance` determination per visit, which is what makes a decade of inspections
#   readable as a series rather than a pile. Enum growth is additive for feed READERS (a pre-2.3
#   records.json stays valid) but a pre-2.3 records.schema.json rejects the new value — MINOR,
#   back-compatible for data, schema refresh required.
# 2.4.0: the `records` feed's closed RecordGroup enum gains `compliance-reports` — a
#   `progress_report:` payload block, the periodic self-report genre added in #2079 for the nine
#   paragraph-33 semiannual reports the Lima consent decree requires "until termination". It is
#   neither `enforcement` nor `inspections`, and both exclusions are the point: a progress report
#   reports AGAINST obligations rather than imposing them (reading nine of them as `order` would
#   publish nine near-duplicates of the decree they answer), and it is the RESPONDENT reporting on
#   itself rather than the agency visiting the plant, which is what an `inspections` row means. The
#   group carries the clause-(f) discharge inventory — a self-reported CSO/SSO/bypass series with
#   frequency, duration and volume that no other feed in this corpus holds; the DMR feed is
#   permit-limit monitoring, not overflow events. Enum growth is additive for feed READERS (a
#   pre-2.4 records.json stays valid) but a pre-2.4 records.schema.json rejects the new value —
#   MINOR, back-compatible for data, schema refresh required.
# 2.5.0: the `records` feed's closed RecordGroup enum gains `permits-pretreatment` — the two
#   municipal-pretreatment payload blocks added in #2172 for Lima's 2026-09-22 WWTP production:
#   `industrial_permit:` (a City-issued industrial discharge permit) and `pretreatment_report:`
#   (the POTW's annual program report to Ohio EPA). Deliberately NOT `permits-npdes`, which
#   renders as "Permits — NPDES": an NPDES permit is a STATE authorization to discharge to a water
#   of the state, and an IDP authorizes nothing of the kind — it governs what a plant may put into
#   a public sewer, under a city ordinance and a 40 CFR categorical standard, and reaches a stream
#   only through the POTW's own permit. Publishing one under the NPDES heading would tell the
#   reader the state licensed a discharge it never saw. The annual report shares the group rather
#   than borrowing `compliance-reports`, which is a report filed UNDER an enforcement instrument
#   (Lima's paragraph-33 series): this is an ordinary permit-required program report, and filing it
#   beside consent-decree deliverables would imply the pretreatment program is itself under
#   enforcement. What the group carries that nothing else in this corpus does is the two counts
#   that must be read together — significant industrial users and effective control documents —
#   plus the appendix limits tables the permits themselves set. Enum growth is additive for feed
#   READERS (a pre-2.5 records.json stays valid) but a pre-2.5 records.schema.json rejects the new
#   value — MINOR, back-compatible for data, schema refresh required.

    growing-season edge, where ET starts to exceed precipitation. ``provenance`` is fixed to
    ``reference``: the climograph is the cited NASA POWER normals + FAO-56 ET0. The per-month
    ``multiple`` overlays the *modeled* buildout consumptive draw against the cited seasonal low
    flow, so that read is ``[inference]`` — surfaced in the SSR table/probe, never baked into the
    mm/day raster scalar. ``available`` is False (empty ``months``) when the climate/ET inputs or
    the buildout scenario are absent — the thresholds still resolve, nothing is fabricated.
