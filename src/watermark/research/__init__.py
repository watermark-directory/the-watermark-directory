"""Automated-research runs: investigate a topic, distill issue proposals.

The agentic-research subsystem behind ``bosc research run`` and the research GitHub
App (Epic 5). A run investigates a topic over the corpus using the existing
:class:`~watermark.agent.client.ResearchAgent` (read-only on ``data/documents/**``) and
emits a reviewable issue-proposal manifest plus prose findings; :mod:`~watermark.research.publish`
turns a written run into a deduped publish plan (issues + PR body) for the workflow.
