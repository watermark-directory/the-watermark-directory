"""The yidam corpus mirror, served to the research agent as an in-process MCP backend (#1563).

This is BOSC's Python realization of ``yidam serve --mcp`` (Epic #1560, workstream E, E3):
it exposes the projected yidam corpus mirror — the ``yidam://corpus/<class>/<name>`` nodes
built by :mod:`watermark.site.corpus_mirror` (#1561/#1562) — to the in-app
:class:`~watermark.agent.client.ResearchAgent` so the agent can browse and query the
method-layer graph (entities, relationships, wiki concepts, profiled people, the leads board,
the boom-origin hypotheses, and the ``[open]`` claims) instead of re-deriving it from raw
extractions. It closes the deferred "method-layer → in-app research agent" wiring.

**This server implements the frozen MCP tool contract** (RFC-0005), vendored beside it as
``mcp_contract.json``. Names are bare — ``retrieve``, ``get_node``, ``list_nodes``,
``open_questions``, ``neighbors`` — because the server is already namespaced by its own name
in every client that mounts one (here: ``mcp__yidam__*``). Tool descriptions and input schemas
are read from that file rather than written here, so a tool added upstream and not added here
fails the conformance test instead of quietly not existing.

Before the freeze this server shared exactly **one name of five** with the Rust ``serve --mcp``
and the TypeScript tools: it prefixed everything ``yidam_``, split retrieval into a keyword tool
and a vector tool where the contract keeps one adaptive tool, returned a human YAML render where
the contract specifies a JSON node model, omitted the ``degraded`` flag entirely, and had no
``neighbors`` at all. An agent written against one server could not call another.

**Why tools and not MCP resources.** :func:`claude_agent_sdk.create_sdk_mcp_server` registers
**tools only** — there is no ``resources/*`` channel — so this server declares
``resources: false`` and serves ``list_nodes`` / ``get_node`` as its tool peers. That is the
contract's sanctioned shape for a tools-only server, and declaring it is what lets an agent read
the hole once instead of finding it through a tool-not-found error.

**What it serves.** The mirror is built **in-memory** for the active site via
:func:`watermark.site.corpus_mirror.build_mirror` — the same projection ``watermark
corpus-mirror`` / ``watermark export`` write to the git-ignored ``.yidam/corpus/`` tree, but
built fresh from the committed corpus so the backend never depends on a prior export having
run. It is an offline read of committed data (all entity-graph enrichments default off), so a
thin peer site still gets its always-present spine (the site anchor + the three network
hypotheses). The build is cached per ``(site, data_dir)`` so a multi-tool research turn
projects the corpus once.

    asserts an ``[open]`` claim, **or** when a property its class declared ``type: claim`` holds
    an open tag — in either spelling. No server may add a fourth, and none may add a blessed key
    name: matching a bare ``open`` under any key would make ``status: open`` on a ballot measure
    an open claim, and no corpus could opt out of that.

    **The third arm is the one BOSC reported.** It was two arms at the previous pin, and the
    mismatch — ``yidam open-questions`` reading a structured tag the MCP predicate forbade —
    was filed from here as `goedelsoup/yidam#127`. Upstream settled it by widening the contract

    *"the corpus that measured 26 open questions against this tool's 2, and reshaped its data to
    `[open]` to be seen at all."*

    The implementation below is unchanged and stays that way. BOSC's ``claim_tag`` is that
    property in substance, but ``_ont_yaml`` declares no properties, so a conforming read of the
    declaration finds nothing — and it does not need to, because
    :func:`watermark.site.corpus_mirror._claim_token` writes the bracketed token, which puts the
    tag in the serialized text where arm two reaches it. Two-arm and three-arm servers therefore
    return the identical set here, which is exactly what the contract says of a corpus that
    declares nothing. Measured across the re-pin: 31 nodes, before and after. #2132 declares the

      which one answered.

      BOSC's projection emits six classes and neither is among them. Zero is the true count,
      not a stand-in for one — `.claude/skills/` holds repo-working skills, which are not
      corpus nodes and must not be counted as though they were.
    * ``stale`` is the tri-state, and **BOSC reaches all three arms**. Upstream compares the
      index's recorded commit against the repository's. BOSC's index (`.yidam/index/`) records
      **no commit at all**, so:

      - no index built → ``false``. Nothing is behind anything, which is upstream's own
        reading of the absent case and is simply true here.
      - an index built → ``null``. It may or may not be current and **this server cannot
        tell**. Reporting ``false`` would be the flattering lie the tri-state exists to

# over a YAML instance it reads `class: gage` as an untagged claim."*

#: The three standings, in the order the contract lists them. There is no fourth.
STANDINGS = ("verified", "inference", "open")

#: is a word — matching it under any key would make `status: open` on a ballot measure a claim.

#:
#: The asymmetry is measured, not stylistic. The contract records that a server which filtered
#: backticked tags as mentions *"would understate a real corpus's open questions fivefold; that
#: rule was measured and thrown out."* Under-reporting `[open]` is promotion just as surely as
#: over-reporting `[verified]` — a corpus with its open questions silenced reads as settled.

#: `type: claim`"* — and it is the arm upstream added in response to goedelsoup/yidam#127, filed
#: from here. In form it is not yet: `_ont_yaml` writes `class:` and `description:` and nothing
#: else, so no class DECLARES it and a conforming reader of the declaration would find nothing.
#: Serving it anyway is not widening the predicate — `_claim_token` writes the bracketed token,
#: so the tag is in the serialized text and the prose arm reaches it either way. Naming the
#: property here is what lets a claim carry the node's own description as its text rather than
#: the YAML line the tag happens to sit on. #2132 declares it and closes the gap.
