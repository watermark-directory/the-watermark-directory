# owner, situs/mailing address, legal description, and a TransferDate (the deed-transfer date). It
# is the live replacement for the Allen-IN / City-of-Fort-Wayne endpoints the 2026-06-19 onboarding
# pass found, which 404'd by 2026-06-23. A PARTIAL fit vs. an Ohio CAMA layer: no auditor market
# values, land-use code, acreage, CAUV, tax-district, sale-amount, or valid-sale fields on this
# layer (those empty -> None, never fabricated). What it gives cleanly: parcel id, owner of record,
# situs + mailing address, and the transfer date — i.e. the parcel catalog + owner/assembly trail.
# Field names are the fully-qualified SDE names the service returns (selected by name, never index);
# confirmed from the live layer-10 ``?f=json`` + samples (2026-06-26). No federal-enclave defense
# scan is wired (Fort Wayne has no JSMC-equivalent cluster to surface) -> defense=None.
