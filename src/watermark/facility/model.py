"""Typed models for the facility compute-capacity derivation.

Like :mod:`watermark.hydrology.model`, these are computed by our own code, so they use
``extra="forbid"``. Every numeric field is a :class:`ProvenancedValue` (reused from
hydrology) so a derived capacity is self-auditing. The cornerstone is
:class:`ComputeCapacity`, mirroring :class:`watermark.hydrology.model.CoolingBasis`: it
captures the per-method IT-load estimates that bracket the answer, the modeling
levers (accelerator-power fraction, MFU), and a list of accelerator **scenarios** —
because the facility's actual accelerator type, count, and utilization are
undisclosed.
