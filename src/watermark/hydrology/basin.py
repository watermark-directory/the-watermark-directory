"""Basin-wide low-flow assimilative screen + derived receiving-water 7Q10s.

The cited 7Q10 table (:mod:`watermark.hydrology.lowflow`) covers only the three Lima-loop
streams read off Ohio EPA fact sheets in our corpus. This module extends the
assimilative screen to the basin-wide POTW inventory (the EPA ECHO Maumee dischargers,
``data/reference/echo/maumee-wwtp.potw.yaml``) by **deriving** a 7Q10 for the major
USGS-gaged mainstems via log-Pearson III (:mod:`watermark.hydrology.lowflow_frequency`) —
``source=derived``: a screening denominator, **not** a cited regulatory statistic.

Discipline (omit, don't guess): a discharger is screened only when its ECHO
``receiving_water`` names a gaged **mainstem directly** — an exact surface-form match in
the curated alias set. A POTW on an ungaged tributary/ditch, or with no receiving water
in ECHO, is reported "no 7Q10" and left unscreened. It is never screened against a
*downstream* river's larger 7Q10 (that would overstate dilution into a false "ok");
including a tributary needs that tributary's own gage or fact sheet. The derived 7Q10 is
the value **at the gage**, a screening proxy for the discharge reach (which differs by
drainage-area ratio) — hence ``confidence: medium``.
