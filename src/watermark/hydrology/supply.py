"""Lima's water-supply storage budget — the intake/storage half of the loop.

The routed network (:mod:`watermark.hydrology.network`) models the *receiving* half: WWTP
discharges into the Ottawa at design low flow. This module models the *supply* half it
presumes, and corrects a structural error in the old single-node "intake on the Ottawa
mainstem" framing.

The correction rests on one physical fact (``data/reference/hydrology/water-supply.yaml``,
sourced from the City of Lima utility page): Lima's raw water is held in **five upground
(off-stream) reservoirs (~15 billion gallons)** filled by pumping from **two rivers** —
the Auglaize (west) and the Ottawa (east) — at *high* flow. So Lima does **not** withdraw
at the 7Q10; it lives off stored water. The binding low-flow constraint is therefore
reservoir **drawdown / refill** (a storage water-budget), not instantaneous intake
depletion of a 0.2 cfs river.

The data-center campus draws *treated* municipal water like any large customer, so its
makeup demand is an added draw on the shared storage and its evaporative consumptive is a
permanent basin loss (the returns go *downstream* to the Ottawa via the WWTPs, not back to
the reservoirs). :func:`compute_water_budget` reports the drought-reserve (zero-refill
drawdown) days and the campus's share of plant production — both far harder to rebut than
a 7Q10 multiple.
