"""Assemble the municipal water-balance loop from cited records + live gauges.

The spine is the four county/Lima WWTP discharges (document-sourced design flows
from ``watch-items.geojson``), each routed to its cited receiving water. The
forcing function — the BOSC data-center campus — contributes its documented FM-2
discharge plus a *derived* consumptive cooling loss (the sourced power-based central
from ``watermark.hydrology.cooling``). The abstraction end is grounded with *live* NWIS
river flow when available.

Everything the headline assimilative check depends on (WWTP discharge -> named
receiving water) is ``document``-sourced; the abstraction/demand context is clearly
``connector``/``assumption``-tagged so it never masquerades as fact.
