"""USDA SSURGO (Soil Data Access) — hydrologic soil group connector.

Resolves the dominant **hydrologic soil group (HSG)** over an area of interest by
grid-sampling its footprint: an ``n x n`` lattice of interior points (``geo.
grid_points_within``), each resolved to its map unit's dominant-component HSG via the
SDA Tabular REST service (``SDA_Get_Mukey_from_intersection_with_WktWgs84``), then
tallied by grid count — an area proxy. One cached POST (a ``UNION ALL`` of per-point
sub-queries) keeps it hermetic; the cache key is the deterministic point grid, so a
committed fixture replays offline.

HSG drives the TR-55 curve number (``solver.curve_number.cn_for``), which reads the
**first letter** of the group — so a dual group like ``B/D`` resolves to its drained
class ``B``, appropriate for the tile-drained lake-plain cropland here and the campus's
engineered storm drainage. Field values are verbatim from SDA; an ``hydgrp`` of ``None``
(no rated dominant component) is skipped, never backfilled. Synchronous (``httpx``),
reusing the shared connector cache/offline/fixture machinery.
