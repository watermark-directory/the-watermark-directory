"""Tier-0 SCS hydrology solver — rainfall, runoff, routing.

Pure-Python (numpy) implementations of the screening-grade methods Periplus used
as Tier-0: SCS Type-II design rainfall, the Curve Number runoff method (USDA
TR-55), the SCS dimensionless unit hydrograph, and Muskingum-Cunge channel routing.
These are *approximations* — fast, auditable, and always labelled ``tier0``; they
are not a substitute for EPA SWMM or HEC-RAS.
