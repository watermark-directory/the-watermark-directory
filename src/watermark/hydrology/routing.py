"""Data-driven discharge routing for the Lima loop.

Loads ``data/reference/hydrology/routing.yaml`` into a :class:`RoutingTable`. Two
flows are modeled (see the YAML header):

* ``wwtp_receiving`` — which receiving stream each county WWTP discharges to (the
  assimilative-screen denominator). This replaces the dict that used to be
  hardcoded in :mod:`watermark.hydrology.balance`.
* ``bosc_routing`` — where the BOSC campus sends its own wastewater, by forcemain.
  Every route carries a ``status`` of ``confirmed`` (document/plan-cited) or
  ``theorized`` (an unconfirmed lead). **Only confirmed routes feed the balance**;
  the theorized "FM-3 to Shawnee II" lead is surfaced as a caveat and held out, so
  "Shawnee II has no known routing" is structural rather than assumed.
