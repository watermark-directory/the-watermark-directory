"""Typed models for the Tier-0 hydrology subsystem.

Unlike the extraction models in :mod:`watermark.models` (``extra="allow"`` because the
LLM emits unanticipated keys), these are **computed by our own code**, so they use
``extra="forbid"`` to catch bugs early.

The cornerstone is :class:`ProvenancedValue`: every number that enters the water
balance carries where it came from, so a result is self-auditing. The ``source``
tag maps onto the dossier's evidence discipline:

    document, connector  ->  [verified]   (read from a record or a live gauge)
    assumption, derived  ->  [inference]  (asserted, or computed from the above)

The models are grouped into cluster modules (``_core``, ``_routed``, ``_supply``,
``_lowflow``, ``_stormwater``, ``_cooling``, ``_sanitary``, ``_findings``) and
re-exported here. :mod:`watermark.hydrology.model` (singular) re-exports this package for
back-compat; new code may import from either.
