"""Toxic-load x assimilative-capacity screen for the industrial water dischargers.

:mod:`watermark.hydrology.assimilative` screens the three *municipal* WWTPs against
their receiving stream's cited 7Q10. This module extends that screen to the
*industrial* side: the EPA RSEI facilities that release toxics **to water**
(:mod:`watermark.rsei`), placed on the same receiving reaches and read against the same
cited low flows (:mod:`watermark.hydrology.lowflow`).

The headline the data carries: the county's highest-RSEI-Score water dischargers —
INEOS, Lima Refining, PCS Nitrogen — cluster on the **Ottawa River at Lima**, whose
cited 7Q10 is **0.2 cfs (1Q10 = 0)**. The toxic load is largest exactly where the
stream's assimilative capacity is smallest, and that floor coincides with the
May-Oct growing-season precipitation deficit the report already frames.

Provenance discipline (the corpus is litigation evidence):

* **Receiving water** is resolved on a ladder, never invented —
  1. a coordinate/name match to an EPA **ECHO** facility that carries a cited
     receiving water (``connector``);
  2. otherwise, membership in the Ottawa River industrial corridor at Lima, a
     coordinate-cluster **inference** (``assumption``) flagged as such;
  3. otherwise left ``None`` and reported "uncharacterized".
* The **screening concentration** (annual reported water pounds carried at the
  receiving stream's 7Q10) is a coarse, order-of-magnitude ``derived`` value: it
  assumes the reported water releases enter that reach, annualized over the
  reporting span, fully mixed at design low flow, with no decay or mixing zone.
  It is a *screen*, not a permit determination or a measured concentration.
