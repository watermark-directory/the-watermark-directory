"""Tier-1 SWMM escalation: detention sizing + sanitary wet-weather surcharge.

Runs the real EPA SWMM5 engine on the campus footprint under the design storm to
answer two questions Tier-0 only approximated:

* **Detention sizing** — bisect the basin's bottom-orifice diameter until the
  released post-development peak matches the pre-development peak (the regulatory
  "no net increase" rule); report the storage volume that requires.
* **Sanitary surcharge** — the storm-driven wet-weather peak (dry-weather base +
  RDII) versus each plant's documented peak hydraulic capacity.

Everything degrades gracefully if the SWMM engine is unavailable.

The engine is version-dependent and may be absent (no pyswmm wheel, or macOS killing
an ad-hoc-signed bundle). So a successful live run is **committed**: the four input
decks land as ``.inp`` files under ``data/reference/hydrology/swmm/`` (chain of
custody — anyone can re-run them in EPA SWMM) and the reviewed result as
``tier1-swmm.yaml``. :func:`load_tier1` reads that committed artifact so the dossier
and tests show real SWMM numbers offline, without the engine; :func:`run_tier1`
regenerates it (``bosc tier1 --write``).
