"""Public-subsidy vs. public-benefit ledger for the data-center CRA abatement.

Assembles, in one place, what the public *gives* (the 15-year / 75% real-property tax
abatement in the committed CRA extraction) against what it *gets* (the developer's own
~50-jobs / ~$4M-payroll estimate) and what it *bears* (the resource/environmental
burdens already quantified by the other threads — toxics dilution, the cooling draw,
the drainage-scope gap, the federal entanglement, the genset air permit, the $14.5M
roadwork channel with perpetual County maintenance, the TMDL wastewater-upgrade load,
and the CAUV farmland conversion).

Discipline:

* The CRA terms, jobs, and payroll are read from the committed CRA extraction
  (``data/extracted/legal/prr-mandamus/cra-agreement.cra.yaml``) — document-grounded.
* **No property-tax rate exists in the corpus** and the CRA states none, so the
  foregone tax is a **screening range** from a clearly-tagged effective-rate
  *assumption* (Ohio commercial band), never presented as a cited figure. An
  open-followup tracks sourcing the Allen County Auditor's actual American-Township /
  Elida millage to replace it.
* The net public cost is deliberately left as a *range with an unknown clawback*: the
  schools recover at least 25% of their foregone share via a **non-public** School
  District Compensation Agreement, and the County's own **cost-benefit analysis is
  withheld** (PRR item 4) — so the deciding figures are, by the County's own choices,
  outside public view. That withholding is the point, not a gap to paper over.
