"""Derive the stormwater the Cole/Beery roundabout could direct into Pike Run.

This grounds the ``waterfall-roundabout-pike-run`` network theory (``theories.yaml``),
whose injected flow had been a 0.5 cfs placeholder. The relator's theory is a roundabout
engineered to direct surface flow into Pike Run to augment its baseflow and flush sludge.
Deriving the actual runoff from the roundabout's catchment against the cited corridor
rainfall **refutes the sustained-augmentation premise**:

* **Mean-annual continuous-equivalent ~0.01 cfs** — a single roundabout's impervious
  catchment (~2.9 acres) yields a negligible average flow.
* **Zero at design low flow** — at the 7Q10 (a drought) it is not raining, so the roundabout
  directs nothing; it cannot augment Pike Run's low flow at all.
* **Storm-event peaks ~3-6 cfs** (2-yr to 100-yr) — transient surges of a few hours. *This*
  is the only flushing it can deliver: episodic, storm-driven, not a low-flow augmentation.

The drainage area is derived from document-cited Tetra Tech OPC quantities (no per-roundabout
area is stated in the corpus); the rainfall is the cited Atlas-14 corridor DDF + NASA POWER
precip; CN / Tc / runoff coefficient are stated assumptions. A *derived* screening result.
