"""Refill adequacy: can high-flow pumping keep Lima's reservoirs full against demand?

The storage budget (:mod:`bosc.hydrology.supply`) shows the campus draw against the *stock*
of ~15 BG. This module closes the loop on the *flow*: the reservoirs are off-stream, filled
by pumping from the Auglaize and Ottawa **only when the rivers run high**, so the question is
whether that refill keeps up — especially through a drought.

Two answers, from the gauged daily record:

* **Normal years — trivially adequate.** The combined mean flow of the two rivers is many
  times the city+campus demand, so in an average year there is far more water to pump than to
  treat (``annual_supply_multiple``).
* **Drought — the binding case.** Both rivers fall below demand for long stretches (the Ottawa
  reaches 0 cfs; the Auglaize near Lima sits below the city+campus draw ~a quarter of the
  time), and the system lives off storage. The **sequent-peak (Rippl) storage requirement** —
  the maximum cumulative deficit of (demand - pumpable inflow) over the record — is the active
  storage the worst historical drawdown calls on. Compared to the real ~14.4 BG it shows how
  much margin the campus eats, and the residual risk is a drought worse than the gauged record.

A *derived* screening analysis. The committed artifact
(``data/reference/hydrology/refill-adequacy.yaml``) is regenerated from the live USGS record by
``bosc refill --write`` and read offline by :func:`load_refill_adequacy`.
