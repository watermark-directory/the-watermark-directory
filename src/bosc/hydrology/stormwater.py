"""Pre- vs post-development stormwater runoff for the data-center campus.

The stormwater impact of the decision to pave the corridor: the same NOAA Atlas-14
design storm yields far more runoff off impervious ground than off the cropland it
replaces. We compute both Tier-0 SCS hydrographs and report the peak/volume increase
and the screening detention deficit — the classic "post-development must not exceed
pre-development peak" stormwater test.

Grounding: the footprint area is document-sourced (the recorded Bistrozzi parcels);
the design storm and the hydrologic soil group are connector-sourced (NOAA Atlas-14;
USDA SSURGO via SDA, the footprint's grid-sampled dominant HSG), each falling back to a
cited value offline (HSG -> the "C" assumption). Land cover is a cited assumption (prior
use "Neff Farms" -> cropland). Curve numbers come from the cited TR-55 table.
