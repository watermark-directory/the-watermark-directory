"""Unit conversions for the Tier-0 water balance.

Tier-0 mass-balance bugs are almost always unit bugs (MGD vs cfs vs ac-ft), so
every conversion lives here once, cited, and is unit-tested. Flows in this
subsystem are carried internally in **cfs** (cubic feet per second) to match the
USGS NWIS streamflow the model is grounded against; permitted plant capacities
are quoted in **MGD** (million gallons per day) per the source documents.
