"""The BOSC data catalog — one typed entry per dataset under ``data/``.

A unified, git-backed, Pydantic-validated registry (epic #631) that finally answers, in
one place: *what datasets do we have, where did each come from, when was it last refreshed,
what's its license/access tier, what command regenerates it, is it stale?* Today three
siloed catalog-shaped things each cover a slice — the bundle ``manifest.json`` (published
feeds), the documents feed (raw corpus), and ~40 hand-written ``data/reference/*/README.md``
(prose; only a few state a license) — plus a scattered regeneration registry (~28 ``bosc``
commands). Provenance is strong per-file (:class:`bosc.hydrology.model.ProvenancedValue` /
``SourceKind``) but nothing rolls up. This module is the rollup.

One :class:`CatalogEntry` is committed per dataset at ``data/catalog/<scope>/<id>.yaml``,
where ``scope`` mirrors the ``data/`` tree and ``id`` is a stable kebab slug unique across
the catalog. The entry is the **declared** half; the **observed** half (stat + sha256 +
freshness) is computed by ``bosc catalog reconcile`` into ``_observed.yaml`` (issue #625),
and ``bosc catalog check`` (issue #626) gates the two against each other.

This module mirrors :mod:`bosc.hypotheses` / :mod:`bosc.sites` conventions: typed frozen
models, a ``data/`` loader, and a structural validator surfaced by the ``bosc catalog`` CLI.
It imports only :mod:`bosc.config`, reusing that package's ``SourceKind`` vocabulary so the
whole tree speaks one provenance language. The heavier observe/gate logic (reconcile, check,
backfill, render) lands in the sibling issues — this is the schema everything builds on.
