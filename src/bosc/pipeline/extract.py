"""Stage 2 — extract.

Turn a scanned cost-estimate page into a reviewed, structured extraction.

The flow is **hybrid** (see the read-mode decision):

1. Pull the page's embedded OCR text via :class:`PdfDocument` — a cheap
   *structural* hint (section names, item ordering). Its digits are unreliable.
2. Render the page to a 300 DPI image — the *authoritative* source.
3. Resolve a format :class:`~bosc.profiles.Profile` (explicit or auto-detected
   from the OCR text), build its prompt, and force a Claude model to populate a
   contractor-agnostic :class:`~bosc.models.Estimate` (tool use + validation).
4. Wrap the result with provenance into a :class:`PageExtraction`.

Extraction is dispatched by *document kind* (``opc`` today) via
:data:`EXTRACTORS`, leaving room for other public-records genres later.

You are reading a civil / utility ENGINEERING record — an as-built (record)
drawing set, a construction plan set, or a component specification. It may be any
discipline: sanitary sewer / pump station, water main, stormwater, electrical,
structural. The pages are SCANNED drawings: the image is authoritative; any text
layer is unreliable or absent. Read the titleblock, the drawing index, the legend,
the schedules/tables (pump schedule, pipe schedule, equipment list), and the
on-drawing callouts. Record into the tool, GENERICALLY (do not force the data into
one discipline):
  * project_name; facility_name (the asset itself, e.g. "Indian Brook Pump
    Station"); record_type (as-built | record drawing | construction plans |
    specification); discipline (read it off the drawing: sanitary | water |
    stormwater | electrical | structural | ...); record_date (ISO if legible);
    project_no; site_address.
  * prepared_by: each design / engineering firm on the titleblock, with its
    discipline and location if shown.
  * sheets: the drawing index — each sheet's id (e.g. "C-1", "M-3", "1 of 4") and
    title. This is the IMPLEMENTATION-LAYOUT axis: how the set is organized.
  * components: the COMPONENT-SPECIFICATION axis. One entry per physical component
    the drawings install or specify — a pipe run (e.g. "forcemain"), a structure
    (wet well, manhole, vault), a pump, a valve, a tank, an electrical unit. For
    each: name; category (pipe | pump | structure | valve | tank | equipment |
    electrical | ...); quantity if stated; and specs: a list of {parameter, value,
    unit} read off the schedules / callouts — e.g. {parameter: "diameter",
    value: "8", unit: "in"}, {parameter: "material", value: "ductile iron"},
    {parameter: "capacity", value: "150", unit: "gpm"}, {parameter: "TDH",
    value: "45", unit: "ft"}, {parameter: "manufacturer", value: "Flygt"}.
  * design_parameters: system-level design figures NOT tied to one component —
    e.g. {parameter: "peak design flow", value: "1.2", unit: "MGD"},
    {parameter: "firm capacity", value: "~450", unit: "gpm"}. Same {parameter,
    value, unit} shape.
  * key_features: notable callouts worth surfacing; summary: 1-3 sentences on what
    the record documents and what the asset is.
Rules: figures come from the IMAGE, never a garbled text layer. Copy numbers,
sizes, and names exactly as printed; keep the value as printed (a figure, a
material, a model). Mark an APPROXIMATE numeric read with a leading "~" in value
(e.g. "~150") AND add a warning — never silently round. Leave a field null / a
list empty rather than inventing a component, spec, or firm. Set confidence and add
a warning for any schedule or callout you had to strain to read.
