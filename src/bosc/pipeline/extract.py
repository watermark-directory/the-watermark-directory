"""Stage 2 — extract.

Turn a scanned cost-estimate page into a reviewed, structured extraction.

The flow is **hybrid** (see the read-mode decision):

1. Pull the page's embedded OCR text via :class:`PdfDocument` — a cheap
   *structural* hint (section names, item ordering). Its digits are unreliable.
2. Render the page to a 300 DPI image — the *authoritative* source.
3. Force a Claude model to read the image and populate an
   :class:`EstimateExtraction` (tool use + Pydantic validation), using the OCR
   text only as a hint.
4. Wrap the result with provenance into a :class:`PageExtraction` and (option-
   ally) write it to ``data/extracted`` for human review.

The reference sheets live at 0-based PDF pages 317 (summary) and 318-327 (the
six detail estimates) of ``PRR-01-bundle.ocr.pdf``.

CONSTRUCTION SUBTOTAL, then a CONTINGENCY AND INFLATION (25%) line, then TOTAL.

  * contingency_inflation_25pct: the 25% line (~= construction_subtotal * 0.25).
  * total: construction_subtotal + the 25% line (~= 1.25x the subtotal).
`total` MUST be populated and MUST be greater than construction_subtotal. If the
25% line is illegible, set contingency_inflation_25pct to 25% of the construction
subtotal, set total accordingly, and add a warning that you inferred it. NEVER set
total equal to construction_subtotal."""

You are reading ONE page of a Tetra Tech "Opinion of Probable Project Cost"
sheet for the Project BOSC roadwork program. Read the cost table from the IMAGE,
which is authoritative. An embedded OCR text layer may be provided as a hint, but
its digits are frequently wrong — never trust a number from it; read every figure

Record into the tool:

Rules:
  * Dollar totals and section subtotals must be read carefully — high confidence.
  * If a digit is genuinely illegible, give your best read AND add a warning
    naming the field; do not silently guess.
  * Never invent sections or line items. Prefer omission over fabrication.

  * description, quantity, unit (LS, CY, SY, FT, EACH, GAL, SF, AC),

Also record the roll-up figures: section_subtotals (the SUBTOTAL line under each
section), then the bottom block below.

Rules:

  * For a lump-sum (LS) item: quantity = 1 and unit_amount = total_amount.
  * If a quantity or unit rate was NOT printed and you inferred it from the
    total, record your best value and add a `note` saying it was inferred;
    never present an inferred figure as if printed.
  * If a section's line items are illegible but its SUBTOTAL is readable, record
    the section_subtotal, leave that section's items empty, and add a warning.
