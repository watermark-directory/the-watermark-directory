"""Summarize the corridor-relevant subdivision meetings: what was actually decided.

The index tells us a meeting *mentions* the data-center project; this runs the
analyze stage over those meetings' text to extract **what happened** — the motions,
votes, parties, parcels, and dollar figures, plus a grounded note on how the meeting
connects to the corridor. Output: ``meeting-summaries.yaml`` per body, the reviewed
artifact that turns the index from an inventory into evidence.

Grounded by construction: the model is forced to populate a Pydantic schema and
instructed to record only what the minutes text states — no inference, no outside
knowledge. The extractor client is injectable, so the orchestration is unit-tested
without network/keys.
