"""Build the static site staging tree under ``web/``.

Orchestrates the generator: wipe ``web/``, mirror the curated narrative markdown
and the whole ``data/extracted`` artifact tree at repo-relative paths (so the
existing cross-links resolve unchanged), then write the generated pages —
landing, per-kind record pages, timeline, entity graph, exhibits. ``web/`` is
fully regenerable; this module is the source of truth. MkDocs (``mkdocs.yml``,
``docs_dir: web``) turns it into ``site/``.
