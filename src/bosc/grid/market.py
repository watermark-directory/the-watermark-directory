"""PJM wholesale-market context for the campus load (#96, epic #93).

The "RTO / wholesale market" layer of the grid & regulatory stack: above the
serving-utility / BA identification (#94) and the EIA-930 interchange layer (#95),
this situates the campus load against the three price signals a large new load in
PJM actually sees -

  - zonal **LMP** (locational marginal price - the energy price signal),
  - the **capacity market** (RPM - the Base Residual Auction clearing price, which
    drives the capacity obligation a large new load implies), and
  - the **large-load interconnection queue** (the data-center / large-load interest
    PJM has reported, against which the campus is sized).

Data discipline (epic #93): NO live PJM connector is provided here - PJM Data Miner 2
needs no key but is not reachable from this environment, so the published figures are
**transcribed** into a committed reference YAML (``data/reference/pjm/pjm-market.yaml``)
as :class:`bosc.hydrology.model.ProvenancedValue` at ``confidence="medium"``, each
citation naming its source (PJM Data Miner 2, PJM Base Residual Auction reports, PJM
interconnection-queue reporting) and flagged *verify / regenerate via PJM Data Miner 2*.
The derived scenario is a **screening** view in the "bracket, don't overclaim" idiom -
LMP varies by node and hour, the RPM clearing price is not the campus's contracted
rate, and the queue figure is order-of-magnitude. **Nothing here is a facility
disclosure**: the campus draw is the first-class ``facility_draw`` from
:mod:`bosc.facility.power` (#87); everything else is published market data.
