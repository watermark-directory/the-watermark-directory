"""Derive the grid foundation layer: serving utility + BA profile + campus load share.

Issue #94 (foundation of epic #93). Identifies the campus's electric-service chain
(cited, not asserted), assembles the EIA utility/BA profile, and expresses the campus
load — the first-class ``facility_draw`` from :mod:`bosc.facility.power` (issue #87) —
as a provenance-tagged share of the serving utility's, the balancing authority's, and
the state's retail load.

Data discipline (epic #93): the serving-utility identification is grounded in the
committed corpus (the relator data appendix references the AEP Ohio tariff for this
campus; the Allen County commissioners' minutes reference local AEP service), with the
EIA-861 service territory / PUCO map named as the formal confirmation source. All three
load denominators are connector-sourced: the Ohio state-retail figure from EIA (shared
with #91), the AEP-Ohio per-utility retail from the EIA-861 bulk "Sales to Ultimate
Customers" file (:mod:`bosc.grid.eia861`), and the PJM annual demand from EIA-930
(:func:`bosc.grid.interchange.fetch_ba_annual_load`). See ``data/reference/eia/README.md``.
