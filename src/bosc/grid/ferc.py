"""Model the FERC<->PUCO jurisdictional seam for the campus (#97, epic #93).

The regulatory layer that sits between the serving utility (#94) and the federal
energy-policy layer (#98): which government sets the rules for the campus's power. The
Federal Power Act splits authority on a line drawn at the wholesale/retail boundary -
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) governs **wholesale** sales of
electricity, **interstate transmission**, and the RTO market rules (PJM), while the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) governs Ohio **retail** electric service,
distribution, and retail rates. This module captures, as cited evidence (not asserted):

- the **jurisdictional map** (FERC scope vs PUCO scope, with the statutory anchor in
  Federal Power Act sections 205/206), and where the campus's arrangement falls;
- the active **large-load / co-location dockets** at FERC (real public proceedings on
  data-center co-location at generators in PJM), captured as cited pointers; and
- a **FERC Form 1** pointer for the serving utility / transmission owner financials.

Data discipline (epic #93): the general law is cited at high confidence; specific
dockets and any transcribed Form-1 figure are flagged ``verify`` and held at medium (or
lower) confidence, with a citation to the FERC eLibrary docket number / FERC Online Form
1 so the reviewer can confirm the primary source. No docket number is fabricated - the
proceedings here are real FERC matters; where a precise number is uncertain it is
described and held at low confidence rather than invented. These are public records
captured as cited evidence, consistent with the corpus chain-of-custody discipline.

The campus arrangement classification cross-references the #94 ServingUtility
identification (the campus is a retail customer of AEP Ohio, so PUCO-retail), with the
behind-the-meter co-location case named as the alternative that would instead implicate
FERC. This seam is the regulatory backdrop under the consumer-cost thread (#91): the
campus's grid arrangement determines which regulator sets its price - PUCO retail
(grid-served) vs FERC wholesale (behind-the-meter at a generator).
