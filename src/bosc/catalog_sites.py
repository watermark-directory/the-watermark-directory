"""Site-aware catalog views (epic #631, issue #628).

Makes "which datasets exist / are missing / are stale for site X" a first-class query, instead
of resolving the eight ``SiteProfile`` ``*_relpath`` fields and stat-ing each by hand. The
catalog already carries the per-site axis on every entry (``site_scope``), so a site's expected
dataset set — and the gaps that gate its parity promotion — is *derivable* here rather than
tribal knowledge.

Relevance by ``site_scope``: a ``basin-shared`` dataset is shared by every site; a
``slug-scoped`` dataset is expected per-site (its ``{site}`` template resolves to that site's
copy); a ``lima-legacy`` dataset belongs only to Lima's un-slugged files. **Presence** is
resolved *for the site*: a slug-scoped entry is present for ``findlay`` only if
``…/findlay/…`` exists — which is exactly the onboarding-readiness signal.
