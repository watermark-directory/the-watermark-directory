"""The air-permit-derived facility power basis.

The canonical ~275 MW IT-load figure that anchors the compute-capacity methods,
expressed as provenance-tagged :class:`ProvenancedValue`s. It traces to the same
disclosed inputs as :mod:`bosc.hydrology.cooling` — Ohio EPA Air PTI **P0138965**
(Facility 0302022054): 114 emergency generators at 2.75 ekW each ≈ 313 MW backup,
which at hyperscale N+1 ratios implies a ~250-300 MW IT load.

The genset count and IT-load constants are deliberately **duplicated** from
``cooling.py``'s private constants here rather than imported, because ``cooling``
hides them as module-private (``_GENSET_COUNT`` etc.) and importing private names
across subsystems is brittle. To keep the two from silently diverging,
``tests/facility/test_power.py`` asserts this module's IT load equals
``cooling.py``'s ``_IT_LOAD_MW``. FUTURE DEDUP: lift the air-permit constants into a
single shared module (e.g. ``bosc.facility.power`` re-exported into hydrology) once
``cooling.py``'s tests can be migrated without churn.

**On-site generation cycle (issue #90).** Beyond *how much* power, the basis carries
*how* power is generated: the 2026-06-10 call's "single- vs double-phase" distinction
is the **generation cycle** — ``simple`` (the prime mover drives the generator
directly; exhaust heat lost) vs ``combined`` (exhaust heat recovered to raise steam
and drive a second-stage steam turbine — cogeneration). The "power-loss coefficient"
the call asked us to verify is each config's **net electrical efficiency** (fuel
chemical energy in → net MWh delivered), carried as a banded assumption with a derived
heat rate (fuel per MWh — the lever the consumer fuel-cost thread, #91, needs). A
combined cycle's steam loop **reuses/consumes water**: an *additional* consumptive
pathway beyond IT cooling, cross-referenced to :mod:`bosc.hydrology.cooling`. IMPORTANT:
the disclosed units are emergency **backup** reciprocating gensets (simple-cycle by
nature); whether any *primary* on-site generation exists, and its cycle, is an **open
evidence question** (#33), so the configs are labeled scenarios, not a campus fact.

**Cooling / mechanical overhead (issue #87).** The basis also makes the IT to
total-facility-draw translation a first-class output: ``facility_draw`` = IT load x
**PUE** (total facility power / IT power), a banded assumption read from the reference
yaml. Cooling-dominated designs reach ~30% of *facility* power (PUE ≈ 1.43, per the
same call), so the band tops out there; the cooling share is ``(PUE-1)/PUE``.
``facility_draw`` is what downstream demand/economics (#91) should consume, not the
IT load alone. A cross-check against the ~313 MW N+1 genset backup (sized to IT +
mechanical) shows the backup envelope is consistent with the 275 MW IT figure only at
the efficient end of the PUE band (``implied_pue_from_backup`` ≈ 1.14).
