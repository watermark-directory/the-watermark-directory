"""Link the data-center's power draw to consumer energy-price pressure (issue #91).

The 2026-06-10 call: "bring in fuel costs at the consumer level due to macro pressures
and data-center demand." This assembles the committed EIA consumer energy-cost
reference (``build_consumer_energy`` / ``write_consumer_energy`` / ``load_consumer_energy``)
and derives a **sensitivity** relating the facility's first-class total ``facility_draw``
(:mod:`bosc.facility.power`, issue #87) to that consumer price.

The honest framing: the campus's annual electricity demand, expressed as a share of
EIA state retail sales and as a households-equivalent, is the robust, fully-cited
headline. The price-pressure band is a deliberately STYLIZED screening illustration
from a stated demand-to-price transmission coefficient — retail price formation is far
more complex than one coefficient, so it is reported as a sensitivity, never a forecast.
