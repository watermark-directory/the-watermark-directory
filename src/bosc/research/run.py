"""Orchestrate one automated-research run.

Two stages, reusing both surfaces of :mod:`bosc.agent`:

  1. **Investigate** — the open-ended :class:`~bosc.agent.client.ResearchAgent`
     (Agent SDK) explores the topic with the read-only BOSC tools and returns
     citation-grounded findings.
  2. **Distill** — the deterministic :class:`~bosc.agent.extractor.StructuredExtractor`
     (forced tool use) converts those findings into a validated set of issue proposals.

The run is **read-only on the corpus**: the agent's tools only read, and persistence
(:func:`write_run`) writes solely under ``data/research/`` — it refuses to write under
``data/documents/``. Both the agent and the extractor are injectable, so the
orchestration is unit-tested without network or API keys.
