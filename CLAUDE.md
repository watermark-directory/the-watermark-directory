# CLAUDE.md — guidance for agents working in this repo

Project BOSC is an **agentic research platform** that deconstructs public-records
source documents (degraded scans, OCR PDFs) into reviewed structured data and
runs Claude-driven analysis over it. Spun out from Periplus.

## Architecture

Three-stage pipeline under `src/bosc/pipeline/`: **ingest → extract → analyze**.
The `src/bosc/agent/` layer wraps the Claude Agent SDK and exposes in-process
tools so the agent inspects real data. Entry point is the `bosc` Typer CLI
(`src/bosc/cli.py`).

A second subsystem, `src/bosc/hydrology/`, runs water-balance / stormwater models
of the Lima municipal loop. `src/bosc/hydrology/connectors/` pulls **live public
data** (USGS NWIS, NOAA Atlas-14, EPA ECHO) through `_cache.cached_get` — on-disk
cache + TTL + offline/committed-fixture fallback, so tests never hit the network.
A new connector is a pure sync `fn(..., settings) -> pydantic` in that dir, with a
committed fixture under `tests/fixtures/hydrology/<connector>/`. External-data
pulls land as committed reference datasets under `data/reference/<source>/` and
are regenerable via a `bosc` subcommand (e.g. `bosc npdes` → the EPA ECHO Maumee
NPDES inventory; columns are selected by ECHO **ObjectName**, never by index).

## Conventions

- **Tooling:** mise manages the toolchain (Python 3.11, uv, node, git-lfs);
  `Brewfile` is the fallback. uv for envs/deps, ruff for lint+format, mypy
  `strict`, pytest. Run `mise run check` before declaring done.
- **Python 3.11+**, `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of modules.
- **Config:** never read `os.environ` directly — go through `bosc.config.get_settings()`.
  Settings are `BOSC_`-prefixed; the model default is `claude-opus-4-8`, bulk
  extraction uses `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
- **Models:** structured extractions are validated with the Pydantic models in
  `bosc.models`. Scan transcriptions may be **approximate**, written `~12345`
  in YAML; `ApproxInt`/`_coerce_number` handle that — preserve the marker in
  source data, don't silently drop it.
- **CLI options:** a `typer.Option` default trips ruff `B008` when the parameter
  is annotated `Path` (but not for `bool`/`int`/`float`); type the option `str`
  and convert to `Path` in the body.

## Data discipline (important)

- `data/documents/**` is raw, immutable, and **versioned via Git LFS** for large
  binaries (see `.gitattributes`). Add new scan/PDF types to LFS tracking.
- `data/extracted/**` is the committed, reviewed artifact and what tests run on.
- `data/reference/**` is committed **authoritative data from outside sources**
  (EPA ECHO, USGS/NOAA, parcels). Each folder carries a `README.md` naming its
  source and gaps; raw API responses stay cached under `data/cache/` (git-ignored)
  so the committed CSV/YAML is regenerable.
- When transcribing figures: dollar totals/subtotals are high-confidence; mark
  uncertain quantities `~`. **Never fabricate line items or sources.** Prefer
  omission over invention. Cite source page/file.
- **Chain of custody — the corpus is litigation evidence.** Never alter a source
  byte under `data/documents/**`, and don't rename or "fix" malformed/typo'd
  source filenames in place: keep the as-received name and record the canonical
  name + a **content-verified** date (text layer or OCR, *not* the filename or
  outside knowledge) in a non-destructive alias manifest — see
  `data/extracted/commissioners/minutes/filename-map.yaml`. Removing a source
  file is only OK when it's a checksum-verified byte-identical duplicate. Captured
  third-party web evidence may embed secrets/tokens — that's evidence, not a leak
  to redact. The standing completeness audit is
  `data/extracted/legal/corpus-completeness-audit.md`.

## What "extract" must achieve

The reference target is `data/extracted/aedg/roundabouts.*.opc.yaml`: the six Tetra
Tech OPC estimates at 0-based PDF pages **317 (summary), 318-327 (detail)** of
`data/documents/aedg/PRR-01-bundle.ocr.pdf` (printed sheets `pdf_page` 318-328).
The extracted tree **mirrors `data/documents/` by collection** — an artifact lands
under the same first-level collection as its source (`recorder/`, `oepa/`, `aedg/`).

The extract stage is **implemented as a hybrid, profile-driven read**
(`bosc.pipeline.extract`): OCR text layer (pypdf, hint only) + 300 DPI render
(pypdfium2) → resolve a format `Profile` (`bosc.profiles`, auto-detected from the
OCR text or `--profile`) → forced-tool-use vision extraction
(`bosc.agent.extractor.StructuredExtractor`) → Pydantic-validated, contractor-
agnostic `Estimate` (dynamic `sections` + `markups`) with provenance
(`PageExtraction`). The OCR text layer is badly garbled (e.g. `$109,307.69` →
`$108.307.89`); **never trust its digits — figures come from the image.**

**Generality (important):** the extract entrypoint is not tied to one contractor.
`extract_page(doc, i, kind="opc", profile="auto", detail=...)` dispatches by
document kind, and within OPC by `Profile` (Tetra Tech is profile #1; `generic`
is the fallback). The `Estimate` model and `analyze.reconcile_estimate` are
format-agnostic — section taxonomy and markup rate come from the data/profile,
**not hardcoded**. Add a contractor by registering a `Profile`; don't add fixed
section fields. `bosc extract --detail` adds per-section `LineItem`s (rolled up
by `reconcile_estimate`). `Number` (`models._coerce_number_keep`) preserves
int-vs-float for quantities/rates and tolerates the `~` marker. `bosc reconcile`
(legacy `OPCSummary`, 25% convention) still covers the assembled summary artifact.
