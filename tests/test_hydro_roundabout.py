"""Cole/Beery roundabout directed-flow derivation: the grounding for the waterfall theory.

The point these tests lock in: the roundabout's runoff REFUTES the sustained-augmentation
premise — a negligible mean-annual flow, zero at design low flow — and the theory's committed
inject matches the derivation."""
