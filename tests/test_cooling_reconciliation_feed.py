"""Tests for the ``cooling-reconciliation`` feed (#1805, epic #1803 P2).

The loader tests are pure reads over the committed reference artifact — they pin the
site-own-rows filter, the Intel positive-control exclusion (the acceptance's hard rule:
a calibration vector never ships as site data, even on a ``new-albany`` bundle), the
self-skip for a site outside the cohort, and the discipline caveats' reconciliation with
the artifact's own meta prose (the distillation can't drift from the canonical text).
Integration tests read the shared Urbana bundle and assert the shipped feed is
byte-consistent with the committed reference YAML — the issue's acceptance.
