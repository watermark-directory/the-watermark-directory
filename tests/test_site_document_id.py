"""Stable document handles (#1887) — and the cross-runtime parity that keeps citations alive.

The handle is minted in three runtimes: Node (the Astro build), the Workers runtime (the
legacy-path redirect and `/ask` citation rendering), and here (retrieval / MCP `search_passages`
citations). Nothing raises if they disagree — a drifted handle just 404s every document
citation, quietly. So the golden vectors committed beside the TypeScript implementation are
asserted from both sides, and this module is the Python half of that guard.
