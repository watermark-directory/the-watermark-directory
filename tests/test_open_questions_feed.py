"""Tests for the aggregated ``open-questions`` feed (#1568).

The projector tests are pure (no corpus load) — they pin the ``[open]``-tag filter (an
``[inference]`` lead is excluded), the lead → question carry-through of the
``lead:kind:*`` / ``lead:status:*`` vocabulary, the hypothesis-cell prompt/provenance grammar,
and the leads-before-hypotheses ordering + dedup. One integration test exports a real Lima
bundle and asserts the feed emits, every question carries provenance, and the two origins
resolve.
