"""Tests for the ``impact-study`` feed (#1804, epic #1803 P1).

The projector tests are pure (no corpus load) — they pin the verdict rules (row counts +
content probes, never presence alone; ``na`` watch states for a facility-less site's
project-dependent chapters), the JS-parity formatting primitives (the shipped display
strings must be byte-identical to what ``web/packages/core/src/study.ts`` composes — the
frontend's ``study.parity.test.ts`` is the cross-language referee over every committed
bundle), the curated gap → lead joins (a dangling id fails the export loudly), and the
serialized camelCase shape the frontend renders verbatim. Integration tests read the shared
Lima bundle and assert the feed ships at the new contract with the expected verdicts.
