"""The `water-seasonal-field` feed — the seasonal climograph for the deck.gl water field (#1236).

Distinct from `air-dispersion-field`: the seasonal read `evaluate_seasonal` produces has real,
committed climate normals + Ottawa low flows, so unlike the AERMOD field it does *not* degrade in
CI — the reference export carries the twelve months of net-atmospheric-withdrawal surface. The
guards: the reference build emits the feed with `reference` provenance, the deficit boundary
(net = ET0 - precip) matches the growing-season flag, and the low-flow multiple screens the
*modeled* buildout draw (so it is [inference], never a measured withdrawal). Reference-site gated.
