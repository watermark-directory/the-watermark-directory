"""The committed-bundle drift check and its lean-trim writer (#2025).

These run against a synthetic bundle pair rather than a real export: the comparison logic is
what's under test, and a real ``export_bundle()`` is the suite's most expensive operation (see
``tests/CLAUDE.md``). The end-to-end half — that a real committed bundle still tracks a real
export — is ``test_committed_bundle_tracks_its_export`` in ``test_site_bundle.py``.
