"""The economic argument as disciplined scenario bands (#1665, epic #1659 ME-F).

This cluster is the one in tension with the anti-modeling method of `docs/defense-nexus.md`, so
most of what is asserted here is the *refusals*: that a band cannot collapse to a point, that no
scenario can serialize as `verified` or above `low` confidence, that a site with no abatement
instrument on the record is not priced off another county's mills. The arithmetic is checked
against the numbers the deployed frontend model and the ledger essay already publish, so the
typed feed and the prose can be shown to agree rather than merely coexisting.
