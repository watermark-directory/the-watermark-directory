    assemblage (#1462); and now ``story`` (#1466).

    Facility is graded ``live`` on DOCUMENTARY DEPTH (#1630): unlike the site-plan-grounded
    Urbana/Sidney facilities, the MW here is a `[verified]` filed disclosure (One Power's SEC Form
    S-1: 30 MW energized / 150 MW contracted — ``it_load_grounding`` is ``disclosure``), an
    instrument-grounded load, not a screening bracket — so it lifts the domain, not merely seeds it.

    ``inquiry`` (``story`` until #1971) is live on the STUDY. The old domain read live here on a
    registered ``flagpole`` walk plus a leads board — while that walk was ``comingSoon`` and could
    not be opened, so the domain claimed a narrative no reader could reach. It now reads Findlay's
    own study verdicts, and the walk itself was absorbed into that study by #1970.

    ``reference`` here is the computed READINESS tier and is NOT ``is_reference_site``, the
    network-global-host role (routed-hydrograph, hypothesis matrix, catalog, concepts, the ``docs/``
    long-form), which stays Lima's alone. The two are deliberately distinct — see ``site_tier``.

    ``data/reference/sidney/parcel-assemblage.geojson`` is the Shelby County auditor CAMA record
    of the single parcel deeded to Amazon Data Services, Inc., which the exporter composes into
    the ``geo/campus`` feed that ``PLACES_GEOMETRY_FEED`` gates on.

    ``record`` moved second, on #1383's standing regulatory watch: it landed the City of Sidney
    WWTP's issued NPDES permit + 2022 fact sheet (``oepa/sidney/1PD00009.npdes.yaml``). Its
    ``oepa/sidney`` and ``grid/sidney`` sub-collections read into Sidney rather than leaking into
    Lima's whole-tree reference scope (the #1505 rule) because both are eponymous — derived from
    the slug by ``*/sidney`` since #1405, so the profile no longer enumerates them. Two
    ``permits-npdes`` records >= ``RECORD_LIVE_THRESHOLD``. That is
    readiness behaving as the STANDING property it is — it rose because sources landed, twice,
    independently.

    ``inquiry`` (``story`` until #1971) is live on the study. Under the old predicate Sidney sat at
    ``seeded`` on its leads board alone, and #1947 was opened to lift it by authoring a Project Rey
    walk — an issue whose own body conceded the corpus could not yet cite the public fight that walk
    would have narrated. That is the shape epic #1968 retired: the domain asked for prose the record
    could not support, while the record itself read live. It now moves on the record.

    What did NOT move is equally the point, and pinning it here is what makes this a guard:
    ``facility`` stays ``seeded`` because the #1630 downgrade still holds — AWS discloses no floor
    area and no interconnection figure, so the IT load is an investment-scaled ``[inference]``
    bracket, never a disclosure. Committing land does not ground a load, and neither do permits:
    five state instruments have now issued across this project and not one states a megawatt.

    """Van Wert rose ``backdrop`` -> ``case`` when #1403 committed the campus geometry.

    Same shape as Sidney's pin above and the same reason: the floor was pulled and everything
    above it was a lead. ``places`` moved on evidence — ``data/reference/van-wert/
    parcel-assemblage.geojson`` is the Van Wert County auditor CAMA record of the five parcels
    deeded to QTS Van Wert LLC in June 2026, which the exporter composes into the ``geo/campus``
    feed that ``PLACES_GEOMETRY_FEED`` gates on.

    ``record`` then rose to ``live`` in #1405 — not on new evidence, on plumbing. The 2PD00006*VD
    permit and its fact sheet had been ingested and extracted since #837, but the extractions sat
    flat at ``data/extracted/oepa/`` while the site's scope reached only ``van-wert/``, so they
    rendered inside Lima's Allen-County record and Van Wert owned nothing. #1406 added the
    2PD00006*WD modification package and its draft public notice, so the domain now stands on
    four ``RecordItem``s rather than two — still the honest count (two permit cycles, each with
    its own notice-side document), not a fabricated breadth.

    The other two stay put, and pinning them is the point: ``facility`` remains ``seeded``
    because the #1630 downgrade holds (QTS declines to state capacity, so the IT load is an
    announced-ceiling ``[reference]`` bracket — committing land does not ground a load); ``story``
    is absent. A future change that floats either off geometry alone fails here.

    #1402 sharpened that same point on a second axis. The campus's OWN first state permit is now
    committed — Ohio EPA construction-stormwater coverage ``2GC08872*AG`` under general permit
    OHC000006, the applicant's NOI and Ohio EPA's approval — and ``facility`` STILL reads
    ``seeded``. That is the assertion worth having: an instrument naming the operator, the site
    and the receiving water is not an instrument grounding the *load* or the *cooling*, which is
    what ``SiteFacility.is_instrument_grounded`` actually grades. The NOI is construction-phase,
    expires 2028-04-22, and documents no cooling system, process discharge or electrical load; it
    even certifies that the air PTI is ``YET_TO_APPLY``. So a change that lifts this domain merely
    because a permit whose number matches "NPDES" landed in the corpus fails here.
