"""Whole-tree guards on the record classifier's reach (#1993).

:mod:`watermark.site.records` decides what a committed extraction *is*, and it is the only thing
standing between the corpus and the `records` feed, the per-site record pages, the citation layer,
the entity graph, search and `/ask`. #1993 widened it from 137 recognized files to 169. These
assertions are the ones that would have caught every fatal defect that widening produced in
design: a rule that steals a record it was never meant to claim, a generic key that sweeps in the
next extraction to use the word, a payload that publishes this repo's own working notes as if they
were fields read off an instrument.
