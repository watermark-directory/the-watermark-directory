"""The `air-dispersion-field` feed — the gridded AERMOD surface for the deck.gl viz (#1232).

Two guards: the gridding factory reshapes a real AERMOD plotfile onto its receptor grid
(round-tripping the committed `sample.annual.plt` fixture), and the reference-site export emits
the feed with the geometry/geo_ref/NAAQS lines resolved, the `assumption` provenance marker, and
the bumped bundle contract version — degrading to empty `values` (never fabricated) when the
AERMOD binary is absent (as it is in CI).
