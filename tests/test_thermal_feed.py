"""The `thermal` content-bundle feed (#1719, epic #1715 Phase 4) — the receiving-water
temperature-rise / CWA §316(a) screen reaching the frontend.

Phases 1-3 built the criteria table, the screen, and the ECHO-DMR validation, but the result
reached only a committed reference file. This asserts the publication: the screen lands in the
bundle intact, the modelled-vs-observed distinction the screen is careful about survives the
export, and a peer site does **not** inherit the reference site's corridor.
