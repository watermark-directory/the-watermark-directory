"""BOSC's MCP server against the frozen tool contract (RFC-0005).

Two things are checked here, and the second is the one that has teeth.

**The served list is derived, not restated.** `served_tool_names()` reads the vendored
contract and filters by declared capability, so a tool added upstream and not implemented
here fails rather than quietly not existing. A test that listed the five names itself would
be a second freeze — which is precisely how three servers came to share one name out of five.

**The upstream conformance cases run against this server.** `tests/fixtures/yidam-mcp/cases/`
is a verbatim copy of `prelude/sdks/parity/mcp/cases/`, so the assertions are upstream's, not
ones written to match what BOSC already did. Each case carries its own `why`, which is
surfaced on failure — the reason a case exists is usually the thing you need when it breaks.

The cases were written against yidam's own tiny fixture corpus, so they are run here for
their **shape** (fields present, filters filtering, flags flagged) over BOSC's real Lima
mirror; the identity assertions that name yidam's fixture nodes are re-expressed against
nodes this corpus actually has. Where a case asserts a rule rather than a node — the
`degraded` flag, undirected traversal, the frozen predicate's two arms — it is asserted here
in full.
