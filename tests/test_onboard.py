"""Tests for the watershed-point onboarding flow (#326).

Hermetic: a synthetic second site (slug-scoped output relpaths) is monkeypatched into the
registry and onboarded against an empty ``tmp_path`` data dir, offline. A brand-new site
has no committed fixtures and no seed data, so the orchestrator must scaffold cleanly and
record each connector step as a non-crashing dry-run/skipped — never raise.
