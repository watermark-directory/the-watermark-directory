"""ASWCD-calibrated campus storm-discharge screen (#149) — offline, hermetic.

Three things the Allen SWCD production lets the Tier-0 model do with primary data:
calibrate the post-development cover to the declared 115-of-~340 ac impervious footprint
(an area-weighted composite CN, not a blanket impervious parcel), screen the single
60-inch outfall's Manning full-flow capacity, and read the design-storm peak against Dug
Run's cited 7Q10. Also pins the committed artifact against drift.
