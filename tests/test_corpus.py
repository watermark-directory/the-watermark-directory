    validates happily, so the type system cannot retroactively detect an artifact that already
    carries one. Both van-wert ``2GC08872`` extractions did — each opened "HAND-READ, not a vision
    extraction … nothing was OCR'd" and then asserted ``dpi: 150``, because the type they were

    ``dpi`` is how a reader tells a figure read off a rasterized image — where the OCR digits are
