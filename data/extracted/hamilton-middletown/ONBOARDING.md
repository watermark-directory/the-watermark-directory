# Onboarding — Hamilton · Middletown (hamilton-middletown)

Living record for the Hamilton · Middletown watershed point (basin: great-miami), scaffolded by `bosc onboard`. Check items as you complete them; the site is **not** promoted (`web/src/lib/sites.ts` `status`/`selectable`) until the gate is clear.

Hamilton · Middletown is the **lower Great Miami heavy-industry node** (Butler County) and the I-75 Cincinnati–Dayton corridor's southern anchor, near the Great Miami's Ohio River confluence — and it is the **established-industry comparator** that inverts every other Miami point: **Cleveland-Cliffs Middletown Works** (the former AK Steel integrated mill) anchors a legacy steel/paper/chemicals corridor of large *existing* water users + NPDES dischargers on the Great Miami **mainstem**, the foil to the speculative-greenfield headwaters. Three things distinguish it: the water posture flips (a large mainstem with real dilution capacity, not a headwater ditch — though over the same buried-valley sole-source aquifer, wider near the confluence); the grid is **split** (the City of Hamilton runs its own **municipal** electric utility — AMP, EIA-861S short-form — while Middletown is Duke Energy Ohio), both in PJM's **DEOK** zone (a *third* PJM zone for the network after AEP and DAY); and the seat is **Butler County (FIPS 39017)**, deliberately guarded as *not* Hamilton County / Cincinnati. (UTM 16N, like WPAFB — west of the 84°W meridian.)

## Dimension coverage

- [~] **Hydrology** — corridor-DDF + climatology connectors ran (Hamilton-centroid, cited; Atlas-14 24h 2-yr 2.82 in → 100-yr 5.58 in). The receiving-water screen is unbuilt: no Great Miami 7Q10 (the derived table is Maumee mainstems only — neither gage 03274000 [Hamilton] nor 03272100 [Middletown] has a low flow) and no WWTP/industrial outfall ingested (`plant_receiving={}`). **Structural contrast (don't pre-judge):** Lima's violations are tiny effluent-dominated headwater tributaries (7Q10 0.03–0.78 cfs); Hamilton/Middletown sit on the **lower Great Miami mainstem**, an order-of-magnitude-larger river — the assimilative question screens against a *real river*, but the actual 7Q10 must be derived and cited before any screen statement. SSURGO skipped → HSG B stays `[inference]`; the sole-source-aquifer claim is `[inference]` pending verification.
- [x] **Economics** — Butler County baseline + consumer-energy ran (high-confidence: pop 389,910, 160,057 jobs). The signature is unmistakably **heavy-industry + logistics**: Manufacturing (NAICS 31-33) LQ **1.83** (the Middletown Works comparator), Wholesale Trade LQ **2.06** + Transportation/Warehousing LQ **1.48** (the I-75 corridor), and Information (51) LQ **0.29** + Prof/Sci/Tech (54) LQ **0.40** — both well below national (no data/IT-hosting concentration, sharp contrast to Greene/WPAFB's NAICS-54 LQ 2.11). **RSEI toxics is now measured (Butler Co, 116 facilities / 91 scored) and it bears out the thesis** — the top dischargers by modeled Score are Evertz Technology and **AK Steel / Middletown Works** (~18M), the active heavy-industrial mainstem signature. Grid-profile ran on the now-pinned serving utility **Duke Energy Ohio** (EIA-861 #3542, PJM DEOK / PUCO; verified from the EIA-861 2024 Service_Territory) — the dominant Butler-Co IOU (Middletown side); the City of Hamilton municipal (#7977) is the Hamilton-side split `[inference]`.
- [~] **Data-center activity** — self-research first pass run (#247). `[verified]` **zero** Hamilton/Middletown/Butler records in the corpus (0 matches across 1,485 document lines; entity graph entirely Lima). `facility=None`; *as of this corpus there is no Hamilton–Middletown data-center land assembly or permit record* — a finding, not a gap, and the economics corroborate it ("heavy-industry node, not data cluster"). The `[open]` sweep target is the **Butler County / West Chester / I-75** boom corridor. **Method note:** the Lima/Allen Bistrozzi land-assembly graph is **not** bridged in.
- [ ] **Per-jurisdiction GIS** — Butler County parcels / City of Hamilton + Middletown zoning connector (the known lift). **The same-name-county trap is acute here** (Hamilton County ≠ City of Hamilton) — verify the situs is **Butler County OH** from a live `?f=json` sample. Flood = national NFHL (wired).

## Self-research (Phase 5; #247) — 2026-06-22

`bosc onboard hamilton-middletown --research` (claude-opus-4-8, 26 turns, $1.09). Findings + manifest in
`data/research/onboard-hamilton-middletown-hamilton-middletown-2026-06-22/`.

**Bottom line.** Registered + seeded but **not promotable**. Unlike its greenfield siblings, its
defining features are an *established* heavy-industrial discharger on a *large mainstem* over a
*sole-source aquifer*. The **RSEI inventory** is now pulled (and bears out the thesis — AK Steel /
Middletown Works is the #2 discharger by Score), so the **Great Miami 7Q10** is the decisive next step.

- **Receiving-water screen — inverted posture, still blocked.** No Great Miami 7Q10 (gages 03274000 /
  03272100 not in the derived file; `derive-low-flows` not extended to this basin) and no WWTP/industrial
  NPDES ingested. The mainstem means the assimilative question is qualitatively different from Lima's
  effluent-dominated ditches — but **don't pre-judge the direction**; derive the actual 7Q10 from the two
  cited gages and cite it before publishing any screen.
- **Toxics is the differentiator, and it is now measured.** RSEI ran for Butler Co (116 facilities, 91
  scored): the top dischargers by modeled Score are Evertz Technology and **AK Steel / Middletown Works**
  (~18M) — the large active industrial discharger on the mainstem this site rests on, confirming the
  active-heavy-industry thesis the greenfield siblings lack.
- **Data-center activity — none documented; economics say "heavy-industry node, not data cluster."** Zero
  corpus records; Information LQ 0.29 / Prof-Sci-Tech LQ 0.40 corroborate no IT-hosting concentration. The
  open work is an I-75-corridor sweep that pins activity or records a flat no-activity finding.
- **Split utility + a third PJM zone — now pinned.** Grid-profile ran on the serving utility **Duke Energy
  Ohio** (EIA-861 #3542, PJM **DEOK** zone / PUCO; verified from the EIA-861 2024 Service_Territory) — the
  dominant Butler-Co IOU serving Middletown + most of the county (the Middletown-Works mainstem load); the
  City of Hamilton municipal (#7977) serves Hamilton, an `[inference]` split. DEOK is a third PJM zone for
  the network. Still open: a cited LMP for the zone.
- **Sole-source aquifer overlay.** The Great Miami Buried Valley Aquifer is asserted in `hsg_citation` as a
  US-EPA sole-source aquifer `[inference]`; verify against the EPA designation record and promote to
  `[reference]` — the groundwater analogue of Xenia's Scenic-River constraint.

**Proposals — all 5 manifest drafts + the named DC sweep filed** as sub-issues of #443 (none moot — the run
knew the site was registered; the missing-artifacts work is done by this PR): the Great Miami 7Q10 + WWTP/
Middletown Works NPDES (receiving-water inputs); ~~run the RSEI toxics inventory + corridor bbox (the
differentiator)~~ **DONE — RSEI pulled, AK Steel / Middletown Works confirmed as the #2 discharger**;
verify the sole-source-aquifer designation; ~~resolve the split utility + pin the DEOK zone~~ **DONE —
grid-profile pinned to Duke Energy Ohio #3542, PJM DEOK (Hamilton-muni #7977 split `[inference]`)**;
and the I-75-corridor data-center activity sweep.

## Review gate (blocking)

- [ ] Every written reference value is reviewed against a cited source (no fabricated values).
- [ ] SSURGO dominant HSG matches the profile, or the SiteProfile is updated with a citation. (HSG B is `[inference]`; footprint needed.)
- [ ] basin-screen coverage is sane for this site's receiving waters. (**Currently the Maumee inventory — a Great Miami 7Q10 is still required. The RSEI/industrial-discharger inventory is now pulled (Butler Co, 116 facilities / 91 scored; AK Steel / Middletown Works the #2 discharger by Score).**)
- [ ] A per-jurisdiction County/City GIS connector exists (the known lift — see docs/onboarding.md; verify Butler County OH, not Hamilton County).
- [x] Self-research first pass reviewed (Phase 5, 2026-06-22; established-industry comparator on a mainstem; RSEI toxics now measured — AK Steel / Middletown Works is the #2 discharger by Score; all 5 manifest proposals + the DC sweep filed as sub-issues of #443).
- [x] RSEI toxics inventory pulled and the serving utility pinned (2026-06-22; RSEI Butler Co 116 facilities / 91 scored; grid-profile = Duke Energy Ohio #3542, PJM DEOK / PUCO, Hamilton-muni #7977 split `[inference]`). Great Miami 7Q10 + basin-screen stay open above.
- [ ] PROMOTION IS A SEPARATE MANUAL EDIT: flip status->live + selectable->true for 'hamilton-middletown' in web/src/lib/sites.ts, parity-gated. onboard never auto-promotes; only one live build (/bosc) exists today.
