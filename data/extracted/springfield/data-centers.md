# Springfield (Clark County, OH) — Data-Center Activity Register

Discover-and-pin register for the Springfield onboarding (epic #451 / onboarding #452;
sub-issues #454 discover-and-pin, #453 Roshel scope-out). Status **as of 2026-06-22**.
Tags are BOSC evidentiary discipline: `[verified]` = cited public source, `[inference]`,
`[open]`. **Nothing here is in the BOSC corpus yet** — this records the *verified public
record* and the specific primary instruments to *pull*. Every figure is cited; none is
fabricated. Two developers are kept as **separate registers**; neither bridges to the
Lima/Allen "Bistrozzi" land-assembly graph (a shared county is not an evidentiary link).

## Disambiguation guardrail (critical)

The large **"New Carlisle" hyperscale** story (Amazon ~$15B; 1,057-acre rezonings; multiple
campuses) is **New Carlisle, St. Joseph County, INDIANA** (near South Bend) — **not** New
Carlisle, Clark County, OH. New Carlisle, OH shows **no** data-center activity. `[verified]`
(St. Joseph County, IN bodies — WSBT/WVPE, 2025.) **No Indiana parcel enters this register.**
The Clark County activity is concentrated at **PrimeOhio Corporate Park in Springfield**, not
New Carlisle.

## Project 1 — 5C Data Centers USA / Vultr (flagship)

- **Operator/developer:** 5C Data Centers USA, Inc. (parent 5C Group Inc., Montreal). Anchor
  cloud tenant **Vultr** (product of **The Constant Company, LLC**). `[verified]`
- **Location:** 601 Benjamin Drive, PrimeOhio Corporate Park, Springfield (former LexisNexis
  data center). `[verified]`
- **Power:** up to **150 MW** max load (City of Springfield FAQ). `[verified]` A ~900 MW
  ultimate buildout appears on datacentermap (facility "CMH01") and various 2025 articles cite
  75/200 MW interim phases — **`[open]`, unconfirmed by a primary doc** (the air permit settles it).
- **Cooling/water:** **closed-loop / direct-liquid** recirculating cooling (not evaporative); up to
  **300,000 gal/day** permitted from Springfield's **public water system** (a >80 °F extreme-heat
  max; "near zero" most of the year, ~30k gal/day realistic); exploring an on-site reservoir to
  avoid the municipal tap. `[verified]`
- **Air:** 3 existing + 16 planned diesel backup generators; "all generators operate under Ohio
  EPA permits." `[verified]`
- **Investment/jobs:** up to **$1.3B** total (Constant Company capital $901,311,378 per JobsOhio);
  ~120 FT jobs, >$14M payroll; footprint 67,000 → 214,000 ft². Utility: **Ohio Edison** (FirstEnergy). `[verified]`
- **Instruments:** City **Enterprise Zone** abatement (15-yr/100%, 2028–2042, ~$95M to 5C); State
  **Ohio Tax Credit Authority** Data-Center sales-tax exemption (10-yr/50%, est. >$32M, The Constant
  Company, approved Oct 2025). `[verified]`
- **Status:** under construction; operational early 2026 (Vultr) / full build late 2027. `[verified]`

## Project 2 — Crusoe Energy Systems LLC (separate)

- **Location:** Springfield, Clark County; exact parcel/address **not yet disclosed** (distinct from
  601 Benjamin Drive). `[verified]` (city) / `[open]` (parcel).
- **Power/cooling:** **75 MW**; closed-loop water-reuse cooling. ~20 FT jobs, ~$1.5M payroll. `[verified]`
- **Instrument:** Ohio Tax Credit Authority Data-Center sales-tax exemption (50%/10-yr) approved. `[verified]`
- **Caution:** "75 MW" appears attributed to *both* a 5C interim phase and the Crusoe project across
  articles; treat **150 MW** as 5C's authoritative (City FAQ) and **75 MW** as Crusoe's, but confirm
  each from its own air-permit/utility filing before relying on either in a hydrology scenario. `[open]`

## Regulatory context

- **City moratorium:** a 6-month moratorium on *new* data centers was proposed at the **2026-06-16**
  Springfield City Commission (Cmsr. Ricketts); does **not** affect 5C (already under construction). `[verified]`
- **Ohio EPA Draft General NPDES Permit for Data Centers (OHD000001):** statewide draft (comment thru
  2025-12-17) covering non-contact cooling water, cooling-tower/boiler blowdown, generator/fuel
  stormwater; bars discharge within 500 yds upstream of a public-water surface intake. Directly
  relevant to the Springfield receiving-water screen. `[verified]`

## Roshel / International Motors "Springfield APA" — disposition: OUT-OF-GRAPH (#453)

The only pre-existing in-corpus Springfield data-center signal was a **quarantined corridor-context
prose note** (`docs/COURSE.md:120`, 2026-03-30) on Roshel / International Motors. **Sourced and scoped
out:** the "Springfield APA" is an **Asset Purchase Agreement** (signed 2026-03-30) under which
**International Motors LLC** (formerly Navistar) sells its Springfield truck assembly plant (~2M ft² on
~500 acres off Urbana Road; ~1,325 employees transferring) to **Roshel**, a Canadian armored/commercial-
vehicle maker, for vertically integrated vehicle production. `[verified]` (International press release
2026-03-30; Springfield News-Sun; WVXU.) The primary instrument and all coverage contain **no
data-center, cloud, or compute use**; the deal had not closed (no Clark County Recorder conveyance) as
of this disposition. `[verified]`

Per discipline, a shared county is **not** an evidentiary link, a manufacturing-plant conveyance is
**not** data-center land assembly, and the Lima/Allen "Bistrozzi" graph is **not** bridged here. The
Roshel thread therefore **remains a quarantined `[open]` corridor-context note and does not enter the
entity graph.** It re-enters scope only on a *filed instrument tying the plant/site to data-center
reuse*. The prior corpus comments calling it the "Springfield-**Beckley** APA" / a "Roshel-APA
**data-center** dimension" (`src/bosc/sites.py`) were incorrect and have been corrected to the 5C/Vultr +
Crusoe thread above.

## Hydrology hook (the receiving-water / source-water screen)

Springfield's screen is an **abstraction / source-water** screen (consumptive cooling draw vs. Mad River
baseflow + the buried-valley sole-source aquifer), **not** Lima's effluent-vs-7Q10 framing. The pinnable
cooling-draw input: **150 MW IT load + closed-loop + up to 300,000 gal/day (≈0.46 cfs) permitted-max
(~30k gal/day realistic)**, screened against the **Mad River 7Q10 = 166.55 cfs** at USGS 03269500 (now
in `data/reference/hydrology/low-flow-7q10.derived.yaml`, #455) and the sole-source aquifer. Confirm the
air-permit power figure before relying on the draw. `[open]`

## Pinnable instruments to ingest (priority — the "pin" half of #454)

1. **Ohio EPA Air PTI** — 5C, 601 Benjamin Drive generators (Ohio EPA eDocument System / Air Services,
   Clark County). **Highest value** — carries the generator count/rating (the power / heat-rejection
   figure that drives the cooling-draw scenario). Expect a parallel Crusoe PTI.
2. **Ohio SOS business filings** — 5C Data Centers USA Inc; 5C Group Inc; The Constant Company LLC;
   Crusoe Energy Systems LLC (registration + Ohio agent → corporate nodes).
3. **Clark County Recorder/Auditor** — deed + parcel for 601 Benjamin Drive (LexisNexis → 5C); Crusoe
   parcel when disclosed (location + land-assembly).
4. **City of Springfield Enterprise Zone Agreement** + ordinance/minutes (5C public-subsidy edge).
5. **Ohio TCA award documents** — Constant Company (Oct 2025) + Crusoe DC sales-tax exemptions (state edges).
6. **Ohio EPA NPDES** — whether 5C/Crusoe take coverage under draft General Permit OHD000001 (the Mad
   River discharge edge, if any; closed-loop should minimize it).
