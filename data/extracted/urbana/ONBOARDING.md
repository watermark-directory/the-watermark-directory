# Onboarding — Urbana (urbana)

Living record for the Urbana watershed point (basin: great-miami), scaffolded by `bosc onboard`. **PROMOTED 2026-07-01** (`status: live`, `selectable: true` in `web/src/lib/sites.ts`); the site is the network's second live site (after Lima).

Urbana is the network's **first Miami-basin site** (epic #440 / onboarding #441): the clean *headwaters* of the **Mad River buried-valley sole-source aquifer**, upstream of the Springfield/Dayton/Wright-Patterson corridor — the deliberate geological **inverse** of the Maumee lake-plain sites (groundwater-dominated HSG B vs. poorly-drained Black Swamp clays HSG D; sink = Ohio River, not Lake Erie; no Maumee-style nutrient TMDL).

## Dimension coverage

- [~] **Hydrology** — corridor-DDF + climatology connectors ran (cited); **Great Miami ECHO inventory committed** (PR #455: 81 POTWs); basin-screen correct: **14/81 screened, 0 violations, 1 tight**. **Mad River 7Q10 derived** (PR #803, closes #445): LP3 **53.67 cfs** at USGS 03267000, 39 climatic years 1980–2024; `plant_receiving` set (Urbana WPCF → Mad River, OH0027880/1PD00011, design flow 4.5 MGD [verified]); `passby_primary_cfs=53.67` [derived] — regulatory value pending the OEPA permit fact sheet (renewal submitted 2025-05-29, not yet issued). SSURGO skipped (no footprint → HSG B stays `[inference]`).
- [x] **Economics** — county baseline + consumer-energy ran (high-confidence: Champaign Co, manufacturing LQ 4.14, information LQ 0.18 = greenfield signature). RSEI toxics ran (Champaign Co, 12 facilities / 9 scored; top by modeled Score: C V Materials); grid-profile ran on the now-pinned serving utility **Dayton Power & Light** (AES Ohio, EIA-861 #4922; PJM/PUCO; verified from the EIA-861 2024 Service_Territory).
- [~] **Data-center activity** — self-research first pass run (#247). **Highland55 instruments read** (#447, 2026-06-28): **Thor Equities** (Urbana Owner I LLC, bhcromwick at thorequities.com) is developing a **47.6+ acre** greenfield site west of S U.S. Hwy 68, Urbana Township (parcel K48-25-11-01-30-001-00 "Brand Investments LTD"). Proposed project includes "commercial retail buildings, an industrial warehouse, **a electrical substation**, roads, parking, stormwater" — build-to-suit for future tenants. Construction planned 06/2026–06/2027. End user named as **"Vance Brands"** in Corps JD filings; business type `[open]`. The substation is the strongest data-center signal; end-use determination still requires a deed, utility interconnection, or public announcement. See `data/extracted/urbana/highland55-findings.md`. **Honda "Champaign-area" candidate downgraded** [2026-06-28]: `corridor_context: true`; no primary instrument pins to Urbana/Champaign County. See self-research summary below.
- [~] **Per-jurisdiction GIS** — **Champaign County parcel connector wired** (`CHAMPAIGN_PARCEL_SCHEMA`, CCEO parcel_joined layer 0, PR #800 [verified]). **City of Urbana / Champaign Co zoning layer** not found — no public per-parcel REST identified; `gis_zoning=None` [open]. Flood = national NFHL (wired).

## Self-research (Phase 5; #247) — 2026-06-21

`bosc onboard urbana --research` (claude-opus-4-8, 27 turns, $1.02). Findings + manifest in
`data/research/onboard-urbana-urbana-data-center-activity-recei-2026-06-21/`.

**Bottom line.** Urbana is scaffolded but **not promotable** — its two load-bearing dimensions are
both open: data-center activity is the **weakest in the network** and the receiving-water screen has
**no Mad-River denominator at all**.

- **Data-center activity — `[open]`/`[inference]`, no primary record.** The only Urbana-specific signal is **Highland55** (a one-line `[open]` lead in `docs/COURSE.md`; it appears only in analysis text — no deed/NPDES/LLC/CRA/zoning instrument). A second, adjacent signal — **Honda's announced "own Ohio data center" in the "Marysville / Clark / Champaign area"** (`cloud-consumer-candidates.yaml`) — is a demand-fit *candidate profile*, not pinned to Urbana/Champaign. `[verified]` **zero** Urbana/Champaign/Mad-River primary documents are in the corpus. **Method note:** the Lima/Allen Bistrozzi land-assembly graph is **not** bridged in — there is no evidentiary link; any Urbana land assembly stays a separate register. [2026-06-28 update: Highland55 primary instruments now in corpus (PR #803); Honda downgraded to `corridor_context: true` — no pinning instrument found.]
- **Receiving-water screen — unblocked (PR #803, closes #445).** Mad River 7Q10 at USGS 03267000 derived: **53.67 cfs** (LP3, 39 climatic years 1980–2024); committed to `low-flow-7q10.derived.yaml` as `mad river at urbana` (distinct alias from the Springfield proxy). `plant_receiving` populated: Urbana WPCF (OH0027880/1PD00011) → Mad River, design flow 4.5 MGD [verified — permit renewal app eDoc 3832476]. `passby_primary_cfs=53.67` [derived]; regulatory value pending the OEPA permit fact sheet (renewal submitted 2025-05-29, not yet issued). Basin-screen remains 14/81, 0 violations, 1 tight.
- **The screen should be a *source-water / abstraction* screen, not effluent-dominance.** Lima's thesis is effluent-vs-tiny-tributary-7Q10; Urbana's is **consumptive cooling draw vs. Mad River baseflow + the sole-source buried-valley aquifer** (which is exactly why the profile carries `abstraction_gage`/`supply_gage`/`passby` fields). The methodology must not copy Lima's denominator logic onto it.
- **Grid is a different zone than Lima.** Likely **AES Ohio / DAY PJM zone**, not AEP — pin the EIA-861 utility number + PJM zone before publishing any grid figure (Ohio, so the cross-state connector axis isn't re-triggered).

**Proposals — 5 filed as sub-issues of #441:** ~~Mad-River 7Q10 + Urbana WWTP NPDES~~ **done** (PR #803 — 53.67 cfs derived, OEPA corpus ingested); ~~a Great-Miami / Ohio-River ECHO discharger inventory~~ **done** (PR #455); ~~source Highland55 via primary instruments~~ **done** (PR #803 — `permits/highland55/` corpus); ~~pin-or-downgrade the Honda Champaign-area data center~~ **downgraded** [2026-06-28] — `corridor_context: true`, no pinning instrument found, excluded from Urbana promotion criteria; ~~resolve the Champaign-County utility + PJM zone~~ **done** (Dayton Power & Light #4922, PJM/PUCO).

## Review gate (blocking)

- [x] Every written reference value is reviewed against a cited source (no fabricated values). All connector outputs are [reference]/[derived] with citations; Highland55 facts are [verified] from primary instruments; open/inference items tagged.
- [ ] SSURGO dominant HSG matches the profile, or the SiteProfile is updated with a citation. (HSG B is `[inference]`; footprint needed — deferred, no facility identified yet.)
- [x] basin-screen coverage is sane for this site's receiving waters. (Great Miami inventory PR #455; Mad River 7Q10 derived PR #803 — 53.67 cfs at USGS 03267000; screen 14/81, 0 violations, 1 tight. `passby_primary_cfs` [derived] pending OEPA permit fact sheet.)
- [~] A per-jurisdiction County/City GIS connector exists. (Parcel: CHAMPAIGN_PARCEL_SCHEMA [verified]. Zoning: not found [open].)
- [x] Self-research first pass reviewed (Phase 5, 2026-06-21; data-center = weakest leg, receiving-water screen empty; 5 proposals filed as sub-issues of #441 — all resolved).
- [x] PROMOTION DONE 2026-07-01: status→live, selectable→true in web/src/lib/sites.ts; sample-bundle committed to web/sample-bundle/urbana/; pages.yml exports urbana.
