# Onboarding — New Albany (new-albany)

Living record for the New Albany watershed point (basin: scioto), scaffolded by `bosc onboard`. Check items as you complete them; the site is **not** promoted (`web/src/lib/sites.ts` `status`/`selectable`) until the gate is clear.

New Albany / Licking County is the network's **third-basin branch** (Scioto epic #484, onboarding #485) and the **data-center epicenter** of the Ohio boom — Intel "Ohio One" + Google/Meta/AWS/Microsoft/QTS in the New Albany International Business Park, the at-scale, already-built comparator to the speculative Miami greenfields. It **straddles the Scioto↔Muskingum divide**: the New Albany city core (Franklin Co) drains Rocky Fork + Blacklick → **Big Walnut Creek → Scioto** (HUC-8 05060001); the Intel/business-park epicenter (Licking Co, Jersey Twp) drains the **South Fork Licking River → Licking → Muskingum** (HUC-8 05040006). The profile frames the Scioto/Big-Walnut side; the Muskingum-side receiving water is `[open]` and flips if the pinned footprint lands on the Licking side. Grid is back to the **PJM AEP** zone (AEP Ohio / Ohio Power #14006), unlike the Miami branch's DAY/DEOK.

## Dimension coverage

- [x] **Hydrology** — corridor-DDF + climatology ran (cited). The **Scioto-basin 7Q10s are derived** (`low-flow-7q10.derived.yaml`): Big Walnut Creek 35.43 cfs (03229500), Scioto River 515.73 (03234500), Olentangy 13.53, Big Darby 11.24. The site's at-reach supply gage is **Big Walnut at Central College (03228500)**. SSURGO skipped (no footprint → HSG C is `[inference]`). **Basin-screen is 0/0 pending the Scioto ECHO inventory** — the live `bosc npdes --basin scioto` pull was deferred at onboard time (ECHO 300/hr throttle, HTTP 429); rerun it to populate `scioto-wwtp.potw.yaml` and the screen.
- [x] **Economics** — county baseline (Licking 39089) + consumer-energy (OH) + **grid-profile** ran. The grid-profile **succeeded** because the AEP utility is pinned (Ohio Power #14006), unlike the Miami sites' `[open]` utility. RSEI toxics ran (Licking Co, 51 facilities / 47 scored; top by modeled Score: Modern Welding + Owens Corning Insulating).
- [~] **Data-center activity** — discover-and-pin sweep + self-research first pass **done** (manifest under `data/research/onboard-new-albany-...`; register in [`data-centers.md`](data-centers.md)). **Verified:** Intel "Ohio One" ($28B fab, 125 cooling towers) + Meta "Prometheus" (1 GW, Sidecat LLC), AWS ($3.5B), Google, QTS (222 MW) on the Beech Rd corridor; Microsoft's Licking plan **withdrawn** (Apr 2025). **Key finding:** the DC footprint is on the **Beech Rd / Licking County / Muskingum** side (not Scioto), but the **source water is the Columbus/Scioto** system. Regulatory spine = the **AEP data-center tariff** (PUCO 24-508-EL-ATA, on appeal). **Still `[open]`:** ingest the primary instruments (Intel air PTI, deeds, SOS, abatements) — see `data-centers.md`; nothing in the entity graph yet.
- [~] **Per-jurisdiction GIS** — parcels = the OGRIP Ohio statewide layer scoped to Licking (Licking County's own ArcGIS parcel/zoning REST is currently stopped, HTTP 500; OGRIP `SitusAddressAll` is null for Licking — a thin catalog). Flood = national NFHL (wired). Zoning = `[open]` (no confirmed New Albany / Jersey Twp REST). The Franklin County Auditor hosts a fuller native owner+CAMA parcel layer for the city-core side — a follow-up upgrade.

## Open follow-ups

- **Pull the Scioto ECHO inventory** — `bosc npdes --basin scioto` (deferred at onboard time on a 429 throttle) → commit `scioto-wwtp.potw.yaml` and re-run the basin-screen. The New Albany Scioto-side receiving water (Big Walnut Creek) is covered by the Scioto inventory (HUC 05060001); the Licking/Muskingum side is **not** (a future Muskingum-basin inventory).
- **Resolve the divide** — pin the operative footprint (Franklin/Scioto vs Licking/Muskingum) and flip `receiving_water_name` to the South Fork Licking River if the facility lands Licking-side. Note: Intel's *process* wastewater is routed to Columbus' sanitary sewer (→ Scioto), not a surface stream.
- **Data-center first pass** — run `--research` + a discover-and-pin sweep (Intel "Ohio One", the hyperscalers); pin each facility to a primary instrument (no Bistrozzi-graph bridging).

## Review gate (blocking)

- [ ] Every written reference value is reviewed against a cited source (no fabricated values).
- [ ] SSURGO dominant HSG matches the profile, or the SiteProfile is updated with a citation. (HSG C is `[inference]`; footprint needed.)
- [ ] basin-screen coverage is sane for this site's receiving waters. (**Pending the Scioto ECHO inventory pull — `bosc npdes --basin scioto`.**)
- [ ] A per-jurisdiction County/City GIS connector exists. (Parcels = OGRIP-Licking substitute; zoning `[open]`; Licking's own REST is down.)
- [x] Self-research first pass reviewed (`--research` run 2026-06-22 + a web discover-and-pin sweep; register in `data-centers.md`). Primary-instrument ingestion (air PTI / deeds / SOS / abatements) is the open residual.
- [ ] PROMOTION IS A SEPARATE MANUAL EDIT: flip status->live + selectable->true for 'new-albany' in web/src/lib/sites.ts, parity-gated. onboard never auto-promotes; only one live build (/bosc) exists today.
