# Onboarding — Wilmington (wilmington)

Living record for the Wilmington watershed point (basin: little-miami), scaffolded by `bosc onboard`. Check items as you complete them; the site is **not** promoted (`web/src/lib/sites.ts` `status`/`selectable`) until the gate is clear.

## Dimension coverage

- [x] **Hydrology** — onboard reach connectors (low-flows, corridor DDF, SSURGO HSG, climatology)
- [x] **Economics** — county baseline, RSEI toxics (Clinton Co, 21 facilities / 13 scored; top = Stanley Works), consumer energy, grid profile pinned to **Dayton Power & Light** (AES Ohio #4922, PJM/PUCO; EIA-861 2024 Service_Territory — the Wilmington Air Park LSE)
- [~] **Data-center activity** — self-research first pass run (#247, 2026-06-22). `[verified]` **zero** Wilmington / Clinton-County records in the corpus — a flat no-data finding, *not* evidence none is proposed. `facility=None`. `[open]` sweep target: the **Wilmington Air Park (ILN)** — Amazon Air / ATSG cargo hub (the "place shaped by one tenant" comparator + an Amazon footprint to set against the Lima Amazon data-center tenant). **Method note:** the Lima/Allen Bistrozzi land-assembly graph is **not** bridged in.
- [ ] **Per-jurisdiction GIS** — Clinton County (FIPS 39027) parcels / City of Wilmington zoning connector (the known lift). **Heed the same-name trap:** verify the situs is Clinton County **OH** from a live `?f=json` sample before wiring. Flood = national NFHL (wired).

## Review gate (blocking)

- [ ] Every written reference value is reviewed against a cited source (no fabricated values).
- [ ] SSURGO dominant HSG matches the profile, or the SiteProfile is updated with a citation.
- [ ] basin-screen coverage is sane for this site's receiving waters.
- [ ] A per-jurisdiction County/City GIS connector exists (the known lift — see docs/onboarding.md).
- [ ] Self-research first pass reviewed (run with --research; triage data/research/<slug>-<date>/).
- [ ] PROMOTION IS A SEPARATE MANUAL EDIT: flip status->live + selectable->true for 'wilmington' in web/src/lib/sites.ts, parity-gated. onboard never auto-promotes; only one live build (/bosc) exists today.

## Self-research (Phase 5; #247) — 2026-06-22

- [x] Self-research first pass reviewed (`bosc onboard wilmington --research`; ~$1.0, 30 turns; 5 proposals in `data/research/onboard-wilmington-…-2026-06-22/`). The Little Miami's second tracking point (with Xenia), defined by a single dominant large-load tenant — the **Wilmington Air Park** (ex-DHL super-hub → Amazon Air / ATSG). Receiving water is **Todd Fork → Little Miami** (a National & State Scenic River, the same anti-degradation overlay as Xenia).
- `[verified]` **zero** Wilmington/Clinton-County records in the BOSC corpus as of 2026-06-22 — a flat no-data finding. **Gage gap:** Todd Fork is **ungaged** (the old 03244000 is discontinued; Clinton County has no active gage), so the profile brackets it with the downstream Little Miami integrator (Milford, 03245500) + the upstream Oldtown reach — a drainage-area-ratio adjustment is needed before the at-site screen is trustworthy.
- Proposals filed as sub-issues of **#492**: derive the Little Miami / Todd Fork 7Q10 + re-run basin-screen; document a **drainage-area-ratio adjustment** for ungaged Todd Fork; run the Air-Park data-center sweep; ~~pin the Clinton County EIA-861 utility (grid-profile)~~ **done** — Dayton Power & Light #4922 (AES Ohio), PJM/PUCO, from EIA-861 2024 Service_Territory; stand up the Clinton County GIS connector (situs-verified).
