# AEDG / PAAC PRR-bundle extractions

Reviewed structured reads from [`data/documents/aedg/PRR-01-bundle.ocr.pdf`](../../documents/aedg/README.md)
— the 328-page Port Authority of Allen County (PAAC) public-records production
("Allen County — Responsive Records — Parent PRR"). Navigation map:
[`PRR-01-bundle.ocr.pdf.index.yaml`](../../documents/aedg/PRR-01-bundle.ocr.pdf.index.yaml).

The Tetra Tech roundabout **OPC** (Opinion of Probable Cost) estimates are the
project's **reference extraction** — the target the extract stage is built against
(summary at 0-based PDF page 317, detail 318–327).

## Bundle coverage

The 328-page bundle is now extracted end-to-end: OPC (roundabouts.*), Roadwork
Development Agreement (pp.296–316), PAAC records policy (pp.80–90), board minutes
(pp.1–79), and seller land packets (pp.91–295).

## Conventions

- Figures are read off the 300 DPI render, **not** the garbled OCR text layer.
- Dollar totals/subtotals are high-confidence; uncertain quantities carry the `~`
  approximate marker (see [`data/README.md`](../../README.md)).
- Validated by `bosc.models`; `bosc reconcile` checks line-item → subtotal → total
  arithmetic and the contingency convention. Provenance is in each file's `meta`.
