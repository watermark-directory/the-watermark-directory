# BOSC site — permit vs earth-disturbance sequence (4110 N. Cole St.)

A cross-document reconstruction of the **order** in which the data-center site's environmental
authorizations attached relative to the documented start of earth disturbance. Structured
source: [`bosc-site-permit-sequence.yaml`](bosc-site-permit-sequence.yaml). Assembled from
records already in the corpus — the two Ohio EPA isolated-wetland (401) permits, the Allen
County stormwater permit (SW1225), and the Allen SWCD ESC inspection series.

> **Analysis, not legal advice or a determination.** This lays the sequence the produced records
> show. It does **not** assert that any authorization was required, obtained, or untimely. The
> one record that would settle the central question — the NPDES Construction General Permit
> coverage — is **not in the corpus** (the SWCD left it "TBD" and pointed to Ohio EPA); the
> timing question stays open pending that record ([#143](../corpus-completeness-audit.md)).

## What the order raises (open questions, not conclusions)

**1. NPDES CGP coverage timing.** Ohio's Construction General Permit — the current generation
**OHC000006**, now committed at [`../../regulatory/ohc000006-construction-stormwater-gp.yaml`](../../regulatory/ohc000006-construction-stormwater-gp.yaml)
— sets the standard in its own words: a complete NOI is due *"at least 21 days … prior to the
commencement of construction activity"* (Part I.F.1.a) and *"Coverage under this permit is not
effective until an approval letter granting coverage from the director of Ohio EPA is received by
the applicant"* (Part I.F.2), for any site disturbing ≥1 acre (or part of a larger common plan that
will). The records show active clearing/grubbing + mass grading from **2025-12-08** on a
**195-acre** developed footprint — far above the 1-acre threshold — while every produced inspection
lists the Site NPDES Number as **"TBD,"** through at least 2026-06-05.

> **Resolved 2026-06-16 — coverage *preceded* disturbance.** The campus coverage record was acquired
> ([`../../permits/lma1a-npdes-cgp-coverage.epa.yaml`](../../permits/lma1a-npdes-cgp-coverage.epa.yaml)):
> Turner filed the **New** NOI on **2025-10-29** and Ohio EPA approved coverage **`2GC08468*AG`**
> **effective 2025-11-10** (eDoc 3898357, signed Director John Logue) — **~4 weeks before** the earliest
> documented earth disturbance (2025-12-08). The persistent *"Site NPDES Number: TBD"* on the SWCD's
> forms was therefore a **recording gap on those forms, not an absence of coverage** — confirming the
> alternative hypothesis flagged here (Turner held coverage the SWCD simply didn't record). Igel was
> later added as a **co-permittee** (`*BG`, eff. 2025-11-12), and a 2026-06-10 modification raised the
> disturbance acreage 304.27→309.2. *Analysis, not a legal conclusion.* **Closes #143 and #154.**
> (Caveat: the NOI's declared "project start" of 2025-11-03 is 7 days before the effective date, but is a
> planning date, not evidence of actual commencement; nothing is documented before 2025-12-08.)

**2. Level-2 wetland authorization vs disturbance.** The narrow Category-1 wetlands (0.33 ac)
*were* authorized first (2025-08-12, before disturbance). But the broader **Level-2** fill
application (DSW401252260W) was received **2025-12-09 — the day after** the first inspection
records clearing underway, and Ohio EPA found it **incomplete** on 2025-12-23 (no practicable
on-site alternatives analysis "for the entire site" — a ~358-ac delineation). A wetland-fill
authorization covering the broader site was thus still pending/incomplete as disturbance
proceeded. The corpus does not show its later disposition.

**3. A separate SWP3 documents the corridor's CGP coverage — for the outfall, not the campus.**
The **BOSC Storm Outfall** (the project's storm-discharge channel, which carries the site's storm
flow to **Pike Run** → Ottawa) is built under its **own** SWP3 — [`plans/4091286`](../../plans/4091286.engineering.yaml)
(Ohio EPA eDoc 4091286, prepared **2026-04-16** by **WSP USA** for operator **George J. Igel &
Co.**), bundled with the Beery Rd./Cole St. roundabout. That SWP3 lists a **Notice of Intent +
Ohio EPA CGP Authorization** as its **Appendix A** — so for this piece the construction-stormwater
coverage process *is* on the record. It is a **different project, permittee, and timeframe** from
the campus mass-grading (a 5.71-ac roundabout+outfall build, Igel/WSP, construction
2026-05-15→2027-12-31 — not the 195-ac campus work under Turner / SW1225), so it does **not**
resolve the campus "TBD." But it makes the campus inspections' persistent "TBD" more conspicuous:
the same corridor's CGP coverage is documented for the outfall.

> **Resolved 2026-06-16.** The outfall SWP3's Appendix A was acquired as companion eDoc **4091289** —
> the Ohio EPA NPDES CGP **Approval Letter** (April 22, 2026, signed Director John Logue). The NOI was
> **approved**; the outfall's Ohio EPA **Facility Permit Number is `2GC08747*AG`**, effective
> **2026-04-22**, expiring 2028-04-22, under OHC000006. (Note the per-site number format is `2GC…*AG`,
> **not** an `OHC…` number — `OHC000006` is the *general* permit.) So for the outfall, coverage
> attached **2026-04-22 — before** the SWP3's 2026-05-15 estimated start: coverage *preceded*
> disturbance, the clean contrast to the campus, where disturbance was underway by 2025-12-08 with the
> Site NPDES Number still "TBD." This removes the parallel outfall gap; it does **not** resolve the
> campus #143 (different project, permittee, and footprint).

## Gaps to close
- ~~The **campus NPDES CGP coverage record**~~ — **closed 2026-06-16**: acquired as facility `2GC08468` (Turner's `*AG` effective 2025-11-10; Igel co-permittee `*BG` 2025-11-12; modified to 309.2 ac 2026-06-10) — [`permits/lma1a-npdes-cgp-coverage`](../../permits/lma1a-npdes-cgp-coverage.epa.yaml). Coverage preceded the 2025-12-08 disturbance by ~4 weeks (closes #143/#154).
- The **disposition of DSW401252260W** after the 2025-12-23 incompleteness letter.
- The **exact start date** of earth disturbance (records establish "underway by 2025-12-08").
- ~~The **outfall SWP3 Appendix A**~~ — **closed 2026-06-16**: acquired as eDoc [`4091289`](../../../documents/plans/4091289.pdf); outfall Facility Permit Number `2GC08747*AG`, effective 2026-04-22 under OHC000006.
