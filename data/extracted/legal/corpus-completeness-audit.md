# Corpus completeness audit — what source documents are missing

**Audited 2026-06-06.** Scope: every collection under [`data/documents/`](../../documents/) cross-referenced against the corpus's own declared expectations — the PRR production tracker, the minutes manifest, the PRR-01 bundle index, and the provenance citations inside [`data/extracted/`](../).

> Method: (1) **Substantive gaps** read from the county's own item-by-item response in [`bosc-prr-production-2026-06-05.response-index.yaml`](prr-mandamus/bosc-prr-production-2026-06-05.response-index.yaml) — i.e. records *requested and not produced*, not inference. (2) **Integrity gaps** computed by script: minutes/agenda filename parsing + pairing over `commissioners/minutes/raw/`, existence-checks of every `*.pdf` cited across `extracted/**`, and the PRR-01 bundle's `derived_files`. Ambiguous date-typo filenames were **not** auto-resolved (the heuristic produced impossible dates); they are listed for human verification. Minutes findings reflect the **2026-04-17 manifest snapshot**, not today.

> **Integrity pass now automated.** The mechanical half — existence + freshness across every catalogued dataset — is regenerated from the data catalog by `bosc catalog audit` into [`data/catalog/COMPLETENESS.md`](../../catalog/COMPLETENESS.md) and gated against drift by `bosc catalog check`. This document keeps the **substantive** half (records an authority *withheld*), which is human judgment, not a script.

## Headline

**The archive itself is in good shape; what's "missing" is mostly what the county hasn't produced.** Provenance is clean (94 distinct source PDFs cited across the extractions, 0 genuinely absent). The PRR production binaries are all present. The substantive holes are the records the county **deferred or withheld** — above all the entire **county-wastewater engineering universe (PRR items 5–15)** and the **item-4 cost-benefit analysis** — plus a modest set of corpus-hygiene issues in the minutes series (publication lag + ~12 malformed/misfiled filenames), none of which indicate lost evidence. A separate, newer thread (§2) tracks **watershed/conservation grant docs** worth digging up — the primary instruments behind a $650k Lost Creek (Maumee-headwater) ag-runoff grant whose SWCD summary is now in the corpus. A third thread (**§4**) tracked the **OEPA air permit P0138965** — the secondhand-cited keystone behind the disclosed **313 MW** power figure, and the expected source of the **three-hall building footprint** — which has now been **ingested (2026-06-15)**: the 2026-05-28 **final** PTI (eDoc `4132514`) confirms the genset count and three-hall emission-unit grouping on a primary footing, though the per-engine ekW behind 313 MW remains trade-secret-redacted (see §4).

> **Publishing vs. holding.** What the corpus *contains* (this audit) is separate from
> what the **public** site *serves*. Every source document is default-deny on the public

> (epic #274 / #281) clears its rel for the
> [publish allowlist](../../site/published-documents.yaml) — a PII/legal-status pass, not
> byte redaction (chain of custody is immutable).

## 1. Substantively missing — records the county has NOT produced

Declared in the county's first production tracker (cover letter 2026-06-05, Clerk of Board Brittany N. Woods). Of the 19-item request, these remain outstanding:

| Item(s) | Category | What's owed | County's stated posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| **5–15** | County wastewater works | BOSC pump-station/forcemain procurement; Shawnee II Phase 2; Shawnee Oaks / Hamlet of Hume sewering; permits **SWPTI-260294** & **DSW-6756**; **1996 CWA consent decree**; **Cridersville WWTP** records | **Produced 2026-06-12 (batch 2)** — BOSC CMAR chain (#469-25→#137-26→#378-26), data-center-flows TO5 (#679-24), Shawnee Oaks (#113-26/#136-26), Hume (#135-26), Shawnee II Phase 2 (#220-24/#937-23). **Outstanding = construction bids/award only** (the CMAR is still at pre-construction). The other named items are **already in-corpus**: permits **DSWPTI-260294** + **DSW-6756** ([`data/extracted/permits/`](../permits/) 4074527/4074529/4074551, approved 2026-04-07, BOSC-1A private sanitary sewer); the **1996 CWA consent decree** ([`regulatory/wastewater-enforcement-history.yaml`](../regulatory/wastewater-enforcement-history.yaml) — Civil Action 3:96 CV 7134, + source PDF); and **Cridersville WWTP** (NPDES **OH0020222**, 2.4 MGD → Little Ottawa, in the EPA ECHO inventory, now linked to the reroute economics in [`sanitary-economics.yaml`](../commissioners/sanitary-economics.yaml)). |
| **4** | Project BOSC | Cost-benefit analysis / projected tax-revenue impact / public-ROI inputs & assumptions | **Withheld** "being reviewed by our legal counsel for compliance with R.C. 149.43 and R.C. 9.66." Not produced. |
| **2** | Project BOSC | County ⇄ DoD / federal-contractor (GDIT, GDLS) comms re the American Twp facility / corridor | "No records"; county narrowed the ask. Deemed fulfilled. |
| **16** | Website | CMS audit trail / edit history for the Sanitary Engineering pages, 2025-01-01→ | "No records… do not manage the county website." **Contested** — WordPress revision history exists behind a 401 gate (see below). |
| **17** | Website | Internal comms re adding/removing BOSC / RFP / Bistrozzi / Shawnee II references on county sites | "No responsive records." |
| **18** | Address | Records indexed to **4110 N. Cole St., Lima** not caught by entity/project name | "No responsive records" (partial). |
| **19** | Engineer of record | County ⇄ **EMH&T** comms | None as to Commissioners; may supplement from Sanitary Eng. |

**The Category-B deferral — once the largest hole — was produced 2026-06-12** (batch 2; item-by-item in [`prr-mandamus/bosc-prr-production-2026-06-12.response-index.yaml`](prr-mandamus/bosc-prr-production-2026-06-12.response-index.yaml)). The production also resolved a corpus discrepancy: resolutions **#113-26 / #135-26 / #136-26** had been mislabeled "forcemain feasibility" — the primary records show #113-26 = Shawnee Oaks **engineering** (Access, $161k), #135-26 = Hamlet of Hume WPCLF ($2.0M), #136-26 = unincorporated Shawnee Twp / Shawnee Oaks WPCLF ($1.6M). These records tie to the OEPA **Shawnee II** permit `2PK00002` in [`data/extracted/oepa/`](../oepa/) and the ECHO discharger inventory in [`data/reference/echo/`](../../reference/echo/). They also yield the **data-center → WWTP keystone** (Task Order #5, #679-24 — a "Data Center Flows Treatment Evaluation" of the campus blowdown stream).

**Item 16 is "missing" by custody disclaimer, not non-existence.** The response index's own rebuttal shows the Sanitary pages' WordPress `modified` dates fall inside the requested window and the `/revisions` endpoint returns **HTTP 401 (gated, not 404)** — the version history exists; the county simply disclaims holding it. Custody sits with the host (AhelioTech / CorpComm-built site) — see [`allen-county-web-vendor-audit.md`](web-vendor-audit/allen-county-web-vendor-audit.md) and [`allen-county-level-sites.md`](web-vendor-audit/allen-county-level-sites.md).

*Universe note:* per the relator's 2026-06-03 narrowing email, any request item not listed was treated as withdrawn — so the "owed" set is bounded by these items. Production is rolling ("every Friday"). **Items 5–15 were produced in batch 2 (2026-06-12)**; **item 4** (cost-benefit, held under §9.66(D)) remains the one to watch.

### Allen SWCD production (2026-06-12) — site stormwater; two "no records" tensions

*Added 2026-06-12.* A **separate agency** — Allen Soil & Water Conservation District — answered the relator's own **11-item (Parts A–E)** request about the **4110 N. Cole St.** site's stormwater/erosion jurisdiction. Ingested as [`prr-mandamus/bosc-prr-production-2026-06-12-aswcd.response-index.yaml`](prr-mandamus/bosc-prr-production-2026-06-12-aswcd.response-index.yaml) (+ [analysis](prr-mandamus/bosc-prr-production-2026-06-12-aswcd.analysis.md)); binaries (4-pp letter + 54-pp records bundle) under [`prr-production-2026-06-12-aswcd/`](../../documents/legal/prr-mandamus/prr-production-2026-06-12-aswcd/). It **produced** the site ESC inspections (2025-12 → 2026-06), the County Engineer's mass-grading approval + **SW1225** stormwater permit ($5,800), and the plan-review email chain — and **withheld the plan sets** under a *new* dual ground (**R.C. 149.433** infrastructure records + **R.C. 1333.61** trade secret — "water and wastewater usage for a data center"), now [withholding-map layer 7](prr-mandamus/records-withholding-map.yaml).

What's **owed / unresolved** from this track:

| Item(s) | What | SWCD posture |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | The **NPDES CGP coverage number** for the site | SWCD didn't produce it (*"TBD"* on every inspection form; pointed to **Ohio EPA**) — but **acquired direct from Ohio EPA 2026-06-16**: Turner's coverage **`2GC08468*AG`**, effective **2025-11-10** ([`permits/lma1a-npdes-cgp-coverage`](../permits/lma1a-npdes-cgp-coverage.epa.yaml)). The "TBD" was a SWCD recording gap, not absent coverage. Resolves #143. |
| **3** | Wetland determinations (the 0.7-ac forested wetland, DSW401251760W) | **"No records"** — *yet* the produced inspections record *"the existing wetland was mitigated."* A produced record contradicts the answer. (Corroborated by in-corpus [`permits/3788677`](../permits/3788677.epa.yaml) + [`/3796349`](../permits/3796349.epa.yaml).) |
| **4** | Tile/agricultural-drainage impact | **"No records"** — *yet* the 2026-06-05 inspection documents an **east farm-tile diversion swale** failure (photo *"East farm tile bypass"*). A produced record contradicts the answer. |
| **6–11** | BOSC-1A forcemain, Shawnee II Phase 2, Hume/Shawnee forcemain (MGD design capacity), MS Consultants comms, **Commissioner Beth Seibert** comms | **"No records"** → deferred to Ohio EPA / Allen County Sanitary Engineer / townships. |

The plan sets are the same documents the County withholds, now shielded a second way; the **§149.433/trade-secret** ground reaches even the plan-share **links inside produced emails** (redacted). Items 3 and 4 are the adequacy flags to carry forward.

The item-1 "TBD" feeds a **permit-vs-disturbance ordering** reconstruction — [`prr-mandamus/bosc-site-permit-sequence.yaml`](prr-mandamus/bosc-site-permit-sequence.yaml) (+ [narrative](prr-mandamus/bosc-site-permit-sequence.md)), #150: active clearing/mass-grading is documented from 2025-12-08 on a 195-ac footprint with the NPDES CGP number "TBD" through 2026-06-05, and the broader **Level-2** wetland fill (DSW401252260W) was filed 2025-12-09 — the day after clearing — then found **incomplete** 2025-12-23. Both are framed as open questions; the dispositive CGP coverage record is pursued under **#143**.

**NPDES coverage thread RESOLVED (2026-06-16).** Three pieces were ingested 2026-06-16. (1) The governing **statewide** general permit **OHC000006** (+ its Response to Comments) is committed at [`../regulatory/ohc000006-construction-stormwater-gp.yaml`](../regulatory/ohc000006-construction-stormwater-gp.yaml) — the standard is now primary-source: a complete NOI is due *"at least 21 days … prior to the commencement of construction activity"* and *"Coverage under this permit is not effective until an approval letter … is received."* (2) The **campus** coverage record itself ([`../permits/lma1a-npdes-cgp-coverage.epa.yaml`](../permits/lma1a-npdes-cgp-coverage.epa.yaml), Ohio EPA facility file): Turner's **`2GC08468*AG`** effective **2025-11-10** (NOI 2025-10-29), Igel added as co-permittee (`*BG`, 2025-11-12), modified to 309.2 ac 2026-06-10 — **coverage attached ~4 weeks BEFORE the 2025-12-08 documented disturbance**, so the SWCD's "TBD" was a recording gap, not absent coverage (**closes #143 + #154**). (3) The **BOSC Storm Outfall**'s own coverage is end-to-end on the record too — eDoc **4091289**, Facility Permit Number **`2GC08747*AG`** (effective 2026-04-22; Igel/WSP). Note the per-site number format is `2GC…*AG`, **not** an `OHC…` number (`OHC000006` is the *general* permit).

### Cross-production referral map (#151)

With three producing bodies now on the record — Commissioners (batch 1), Sanitary Engineer instruments (batch 2), and the ASWCD — the "no records" answers form a **referral structure**: each body disclaims a slice and points to the next. Mapped item-by-item (who disclaimed, who they pointed to, whether anyone produced it) in [`cross-production-referral-map.yaml`](cross-production-referral-map.yaml).

| Item(s) | Disclaiming body | Pointed to | Producer in corpus? |
|---|---|---|---|
| County 5–15 | Commissioners | Sanitary Engineer | **Yes** — produced in batch 2 *(the referral that didn't dead-end)* |
| County 16 (CMS edit history) | Commissioners | third-party web host | No — records exist at the host (WordPress; REST API 401, not 404) |
| County 19 (EMH&T comms) | Commissioners | Sanitary Engineer | No County↔EMH&T comms produced (ASWCD produced its *own* EMH&T emails) |
| ASWCD 6 (BOSC-1A forcemain NPDES/SWPPP/ESC) | ASWCD | Ohio EPA / Sanitary Eng | No — batch 2 gave procurement, not the environmental-stormwater records |
| ASWCD 8 (Shawnee II Ph2 stormwater/ESC) | ASWCD | Ohio EPA / Sanitary Eng | No — batch 2 gave the upgrade *resolutions*, not the ESC/NPDES records |
| ASWCD 9 (Hume/Shawnee forcemain **MGD capacity**) | ASWCD | Ohio EPA / Sanitary Eng | No — batch 2 gave financing + the engineering *contract*, not the MGD figure |
| ASWCD 7 (forcemain drainage/tile/wetland) | ASWCD | Sanitary Eng / **townships** | No — townships not yet a requested custodian |

**Headline:** the corridor-level **environmental** records (NPDES construction-stormwater / SWPPP / ESC for the forcemain corridors and Shawnee II Phase 2, plus the item-9 MGD design capacity) are owned by *no* county body — each points to Ohio EPA or the townships. The County's Sanitary-Engineer batch produced the **procurement / financing / resolution** layer of those same projects but not their environmental-permit layer. A routing map, not an accusation — but it isolates exactly where the relator must go next (Ohio EPA; the townships) and which referral already resolved (Commissioners→Sanitary, items 5–15).

## 2. Watershed / conservation grant docs — to dig up

A captured Allen SWCD project page entered the corpus 2026-06-06 as
[`watershed/osu-lima-ag-runoff.allenswcd.2026-06-06.pdf`](../../documents/watershed/osu-lima-ag-runoff.allenswcd.2026-06-06.pdf)
(extraction: [`watershed/osu-lima-ag-runoff-treatment.capture.yaml`](../watershed/osu-lima-ag-runoff-treatment.capture.yaml)).
It documents a **$650,000** ag-runoff retention/treatment grant (Project
`ALLENSWCD-FDFARM22`) on **Lost Creek HUC12 `041000070305`** — a Maumee headwater
2.7 mi east of I-75 — i.e. baseline nutrient-burden context for the hydrology
axis. The page is a **secondary SWCD summary**.

The project's **Lead PI, Dr. Vinayak S. Shedekar (OSU FABE)**, was identified from
the page; his **CV** ([`shedekar-cv.2025-09-28.pdf`](../../documents/watershed/shedekar-cv.2025-09-28.pdf),
provided 2026-06-06; bibliography at
[`../watershed/shedekar-vinayak.bibliography.md`](../watershed/shedekar-vinayak.bibliography.md))
**resolved the funding source**: Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI), subaward
through **Ohio EPA**, OSU portion **$327,450**, term **2023–2025** (CV grant #13) —
closing the prior `[open]`. The primary instruments still owed:

| Item | What's owed | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| **Grant agreement / award instrument** | The signed **GLRI / Ohio EPA** subaward itself — deliverables, match, reporting (program now known; instrument not in hand) | Ohio EPA GLRI subaward files; Allen SWCD; public-records request |
| **OSU application & conceptual design** | Engineering basis for the BMPs (berm/wetland/forebay/pump-vault; saturated buffer) | OSU FABE (Dr. V. Shedekar); Allen SWCD project file |
| **Load-reduction estimate table** | Referenced on the captured page ("provided in the table below") but **not transcribed** in the capture | Re-capture full page / SWCD project file |
| **OSU monitoring data** | Continuous flow + water-quality (3 sites, ISCO6712 samplers) — quantifies actual nutrient/flow reduction | OSU Overholt Drainage program |

These quantify the **existing** Maumee-headwater load and remediation spend the
corpus reasons against; the funding source is now verified, the rest not yet in
hand. Cross-ref the ECHO Maumee discharger inventory
([`../../reference/echo/`](../../reference/echo/)) and
[`../../../docs/HYDROLOGY.md`](../../../docs/HYDROLOGY.md).

## 3. Corpus-integrity gaps (minor)

### Commissioners minutes series — broadly complete

934 files in [`commissioners/minutes/raw/`](../../documents/commissioners/minutes/) spanning 2023–2026: **475 agendas (`A…`) / 453 minutes (`M…`)**, 468 distinct meeting-dates parsed. The 22-file agenda/minutes asymmetry is **mostly not real absence**:

- **Recent publication lag (not a gap):** 12 dates **2026-03-03 → 2026-04-20** have an agenda but no minutes — these are the most recent meetings relative to the 2026-04-17 manifest snapshot; minutes simply weren't posted yet.
- **Partial 2023 backfill (scope, not loss):** an 8-date cluster in **Dec 2023** (agendas, no minutes) sits in the partially-backfilled 2023 range (the corpus is pinned to 2024–2026).
- **Typo'd agendas masquerading as gaps:** several early-2024 "minutes, no agenda" dates *do* have an agenda under a malformed name — e.g. `A20524-Special.pdf` (2024-02-05), `A22124-Special-1.pdf` (2024-02-21), `A22824-Special.pdf` (2024-02-28).

### ~12 malformed / misfiled filenames (break automated indexing)

| Filename | Issue |
|---|---|
| `Govt.-Structure-Org-Chart-1.pdf` | **Not a meeting record** — reference handout misfiled in `minutes/raw/` |
| `Mayors-and-Zoning-Persons.pdf` | **Not a meeting record** — contact list misfiled |
| `Township-Trustees-Fiscal-Officers.pdf` | **Not a meeting record** — contact list misfiled |
| `CANCELLED-MEETING.pdf` | Cancelled-meeting placeholder (no date) |
| `Board-of-Commissioners-General-Session-September-9-2025-Meeting-Minutes.pdf` | Long-form name for the **2025-09-09 minutes** (should be `M090925.pdf`) |
| `ACC-M102423.pdf` | Stray `ACC-` prefix (minutes 2023-10-24) |
| `A0101024.pdf`, `A0404024.pdf`, `M0115226.pdf` | **7-digit date typos — ambiguous**; verify against the source before renaming |
| `A20524-Special.pdf`, `A22124-Special-1.pdf`, `A22824-Special.pdf` | 5-digit dates (leading zero dropped) |

### PRR-01 bundle derived files — not committed (low concern)

The [bundle index](../../documents/aedg/PRR-01-bundle.ocr.pdf.index.yaml) references seven `derived_files` (`Allen_County_PRR_searchable.pdf`, `..._full_text.txt`, `..._exhibit_index.txt`, `Allen_County_Project_Master_Table.md`, `WATERMARK_Tetra_Tech_OPC.yaml`, `WATERMARK_OPC_Detailed_Line_Items.yaml`). None are in `data/documents/aedg/` — but they are **regenerable derivatives** of `PRR-01-bundle.ocr.pdf`, which **is** present. Not lost source material.

### Sanitary as-built present but not yet extracted

*Added 2026-06-11 (issue #41).* [`sanitary/indianbrook-ps-asbuilt-2007.pdf`](../../documents/sanitary/indianbrook-ps-asbuilt-2007.pdf) — the 2007 Indian Brook pump-station as-built (4-page scan, **no text layer**) — is **present** in the corpus but **not yet grounded**: `data/extracted/sanitary/` carries no structured extraction, so the 8" forcemain / three-phase upgrade it documents is cited only secondhand (`data/reference/periplus/watch-items.geojson` "2007 as-built"; [`../../../docs/legal/mandamus-analysis.md`](../../../docs/legal/mandamus-analysis.md) §503). The discipline-agnostic `kind=engineering` / `kind=sanitary` extractor (`watermark.pipeline.extract.extract_engineering`) now exists; the structured `.sanitary.yaml` awaits a keyed vision pass (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, tracked in #124). This is the one piece of sanitary as-built evidence that **is** in hand against the Category-B wastewater hole above (§1, items 5–15).

### Provenance — clean

Every `*.pdf` cited across `extracted/**` resolves to a real file under `data/documents/`. (Of 94 distinct cited names, the only 2 "unresolved" are false positives: a Google-Slides export title and a prose fragment, not file references.) The 5 PRR-production binaries named in the response index are all present in [`prr-production-2026-06-05/`](../../documents/legal/prr-mandamus/prr-production-2026-06-05/) — the index's "binaries to be added" note is stale.

---

## 4. Air permit (PTI P0138965) — keystone power figure — **INGESTED 2026-06-15**

*Added 2026-06-09 (compute-capacity axis); **resolved 2026-06-15**.* The Ohio EPA Air **Permit-to-Install P0138965** (Facility **0302022054**) is the keystone behind the campus's disclosed electrical scale — **114 emergency generators × 2,750 ekW ≈ 313 MW backup → ~250–300 MW IT** (N+1) — anchoring both the cooling-water balance ([`../../../docs/HYDROLOGY.md`](../../../docs/HYDROLOGY.md); `watermark.hydrology.cooling`) and the compute / AI-capacity derivation ([`../../../docs/COMPUTE.md`](../../../docs/COMPUTE.md); `watermark.facility`).

**Now ingested.** The 2026-05-28 **final** PTI (Ohio EPA eDocument `4132514`, 66 pp incl. a 64-item Response to Comments) is committed at [`../../documents/permits/bistrozzi-permits/4132514.pdf`](../../documents/permits/bistrozzi-permits/4132514.pdf) → [`../permits/4132514.epa.yaml`](../permits/4132514.epa.yaml). It joins the already-committed 2025-12-10 **draft** of the same permit ([`3987141`](../permits/3987141.epa.yaml) / [`3987144`](../permits/3987144.epa.yaml)) — which it supersedes and whose flagged 114-vs-115 generator discrepancy it resolves.

**What it puts on a primary footing:**

- **Genset count + the three-hall grouping.** 115 emissions units P001–P115 — P001–P114 are identical data-hall gensets in **three groups of 38** (GEN 1/2/3), P115 is a separate, smaller **HUBGEN**; the 36 cooling towers are **three groups of 12** (TWR 1/2/3). The three-group emission-unit structure corroborates the anticipated **≈ three data halls** (38 gensets + 12 towers each).
- **Synthetic-minor caps:** NOx **235.62 tpy** + CO **96.06 tpy** (rolling 12-month, P001–P115 combined) — the federally enforceable limits keeping the facility under major-source NSR (it is **major for Title V**); Tier 2 CI engines under 40 CFR 60 Subpart IIII, fueled ULSD/HVO ≤ 15 ppm S.

**What it does NOT resolve (carry forward):**

| Still owed | Why | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| **Per-engine ekW / engine make-model** — **CBI-LOCKED, confirmed 2026-06-16 (#159)** | The DAPC application file was acquired: Ohio EPA **granted trade-secret protection** for the "size/rating of emergency generators and fire pumps" (OAC 3745-49-03, grant 2025-10-08; [`permits/3859883`](../permits/3859883.epa.yaml) + justification 3859888). The exact ekW lives only in the *confidential* version of A0080278; the **2,750 ekW × 114 ≈ 313 MW** basis stays the **draft public-notice** figure and is not obtainable absent a legal challenge to the designation. Surviving public brackets: main gensets **≥ 560 kW** (Tier 2). | **Closed** — only a trade-secret challenge would unlock it |
| **Emission-unit plot plan / building footprint** — also **trade-secret-shielded** (#160) | The same trade-secret grant covers **"internal layout details"** — so the footprint is shielded at the DAPC level too (atop the County/ASWCD R.C. 149.433 + 1333.61 withholding). Method 3 stays the land-area envelope. | Township building-permit filings; a trade-secret/PRR challenge |
| **Architectural site-plan sheets** (CI Design / WSP) | The committed plan set is a **single** grading & storm sheet (`1A-C-3104`) showing only ancillary **SSS/GPS** buildings on piers — the data-hall footprints sit on architectural sheets not in hand (see #160). | EMH&T / CI Design plan set; PRR follow-up |

**Net:** the genset count, three-hall emission-unit grouping, and synthetic-minor caps are **primary-source**; the **313 MW per-unit ekW** is now **confirmed trade-secret-locked** (#159 closed — the application file withholds it under an Ohio EPA OAC 3745-49-03 grant), so it permanently rests on the draft public notice absent a legal challenge; and **Method 3 stays the land-area envelope** — the floor area / internal layout is itself trade-secret-claimed (#160).

  2023-03-22, 2023-06-21, 2025-08-13, 2025-11-14 — all confirmed "-Special Session"
  upstream. *(Correction: 2024-06-20, also on the old shortlist, is **not** special —
  the held `M062024.pdf` is a regular Thursday session; its agenda is genuinely
  absent upstream, the county never posted an `A062024`.)*
- **Agenda present, minutes never captured → genuine upstream absence (county never posted minutes):**
  2024-09-25 (Wed between regular Tue/Thu sessions), 2024-12-30 (year-end special
  session), 2025-12-30 (the county page's "December 30, 2025" minutes link is
  mislabeled — its href points to the Dec 23 file `M122325.pdf`; no real
  `M123025.pdf` exists upstream).

No corpus action required for any of the 8.

**Full civic cutover (2026-06-12, #133 follow-on):** the commissioners' entire meeting
record (Jan 2023–, 991 files) is now **connector-sourced** under
[`data/documents/commissioners/meetings/`](../../documents/commissioners/meetings/).
The legacy hand-assembled `minutes/raw/` tree (930 PDFs) was **retired** after every
file was verified **byte-identical** to its connector copy — the per-file record is
[`cutover-reconciliation.yaml`](../commissioners/meetings/cutover-reconciliation.yaml)
(930/930 matched, 0 retained). The download manifest + meeting index sit alongside it.
**OCR pass complete (2026-06-12, #135):** all 991 files text-extracted, **969/991 dates
content-verified** and **270 meetings flagged for corridor topics** (up from 497/91 when only
the agendas had a text layer). The "934 files in `minutes/raw/`" figures above describe the
pre-cutover 2026-04-17 snapshot.
