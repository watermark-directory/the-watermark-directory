# Water-balance scenarios

Named what-if inputs for the hydrology water-balance model (`watermark.hydrology.scenario`).
Each scenario is a committed YAML of tagged inputs (value, unit, `source`, `citation`,
`confidence`, `asof`) that the model runs over.

## Files

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `baseline.scenario.yaml` | Current municipal loop, **no** data-center cooling draw (cooling demand 0.0 MGD). The reference case. |
| `buildout.scenario.yaml` | The corridor build-out case with campus cooling load. |

## Conventions

Every input carries a `source` tag (`assumption` vs. measured/derived) and a
`citation`/`confidence` — keep these honest. An `assumption` is a stated modeling
input, not a fact; surface it as such in any report. Add a new scenario by copying
the structure and adjusting the tagged inputs.
