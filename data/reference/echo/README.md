# Maumee-watershed NPDES inventory (EPA ECHO)

Verified inventory of CWA-permitted facilities in the **Maumee River watershed**,
pulled from EPA's **ECHO Clean Water Act REST services** (`cwa_rest_services`).
Every facility, NPDES ID, and value here was returned by the ECHO API — nothing is
fabricated, inferred, or filled in. Regenerate with `bosc npdes`.

## What the watershed is

Seven USGS **HUC-8** subbasins (subregion 0410, Western Lake Erie), queried one at
a time via `p_huc`:

| HUC-8 | subbasin | states |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 04100003 | St. Joseph | IN, MI, OH |
| 04100004 | St. Marys | IN, OH |
| 04100005 | Upper Maumee | IN, OH |
| 04100006 | Tiffin | OH, MI |
| 04100007 | Auglaize | OH |
| 04100008 | Blanchard | OH |
| 04100009 | Lower Maumee | OH |

Adjacent WLE subbasins **04100001** (Ottawa-Stony), **04100002** (Raisin), and
**04100010** (Cedar-Portage) are *not* Maumee drainage and are excluded.

## Files

- [**`maumee-wwtp.all-npdes.csv`**](maumee-wwtp.all-npdes.csv) — all active
  CWA-permitted facilities ECHO returns for the seven HUC-8s, deduplicated to one
  row per facility by FRS Registry ID (POTW + non-POTW + federal + private/package).
- [**`maumee-wwtp.potw.csv`**](maumee-wwtp.potw.csv) — subset flagged `POTW` by
  ECHO's `CWPFacilityTypeIndicator` (the municipal sewage plants).
- [**`maumee-wwtp.huc-counts.csv`**](maumee-wwtp.huc-counts.csv) — per-HUC
  manifest: ECHO's reported count vs. rows actually pulled (they match — no
  pagination loss), plus dedup totals.

## Method

Per HUC-8: `get_facilities` (`p_huc=<HUC8>`, `p_act=Y`) returns a QID + summary
count; `get_qid` pages the rows as JSON, columns selected **by name** (mapped to
ECHO ColumnIDs). Deduplication keys on **FRS Registry ID**; a facility holding
multiple permits keeps its primary NPDES ID with the rest in
`npdes_ids_secondary`. Two distinct FRS IDs sharing a name are never collapsed.

Verified against `cwa_rest_services` metadata **CWA v2017-10-13 1325** (260 result
columns). Numbers come from the API's structured fields, not any text layer.

## Headline counts (last pull)

1,057 active-permit rows across the 7 HUC-8s → **1,006 facilities** after FRS
dedup: **129 POTW**, 875 non-POTW, 2 federal. POTW design flow present for
112/129 (the 17 blanks are mostly Michigan general-permit stabilization lagoons
that don't report a design-flow number).

## Known gaps & caveats (read before using)

1. **No CWNS ID.** The ECHO CWA facility service has *no* CWNS column, so the
   requested CWNS cross-check for POTWs is not available from this API. POTW
   classification here rests solely on `CWPFacilityTypeIndicator`. (CWNS IDs would
   have to come from the Clean Watersheds Needs Survey, separately.)

2. **HUC geocoding (WATERS).** ECHO links facilities to HUCs via WATERS; not every
   NPDES ID geocodes, so a pure watershed query can miss facilities whose
   coordinates didn't resolve. `RadWBDHu8` is frequently null in the raw data — we
   use `FacDerivedHuc` (which reliably reflects the queried HUC-8) instead.

3. **Cross-state completeness.** Four subbasins (St. Joseph, St. Marys, Upper
   Maumee, Tiffin) extend into Indiana and/or Michigan. ECHO's `p_huc` *did*
   return IN/MI facilities (e.g. Auburn IN, Amboy Twp MI), but for a complete
   inventory this pull should still be cross-checked against **Ohio EPA**,
   **Indiana IDEM**, and **Michigan EGLE** NPDES permit lists; any facility in a
   state list but absent from ECHO should be flagged. *(Not yet performed — those
   state datasets are a follow-up; this is an ECHO-only inventory.)*

4. **"All" is the active CWA universe, not just process wastewater.** `p_act=Y`
   includes some non-NPDES Industrial-User/pretreatment permits and stormwater
   general permits alongside true wastewater dischargers. The `permit_type`
   (`CWPPermitTypeDesc`) and `facility_type` columns make the distinction visible
   — filter on them rather than assuming every row is a wastewater outfall.

5. **`ottawa_discharge` undercounts.** This optional flag is keyed on ECHO's
   `CWPStateWaterBodyName` string, which is null for ~70% of the Ohio rows —
   including **Lima WWTP (OH0026069, 18.5 MGD)**, the largest Lima-area POTW, which
   discharges to the Ottawa River but has no receiving-water value in ECHO. Per the
   "no inference" rule we do *not* backfill it. Use `in_lima_subbasin` (every
   Auglaize + Blanchard row) plus `county` for the broad Lima/Allen screen, and
   treat `ottawa_discharge=Y` as a floor, not a complete list.
