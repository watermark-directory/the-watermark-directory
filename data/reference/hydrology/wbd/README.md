# `wbd/` — USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset (HUC boundaries)

Authoritative Hydrologic Unit (HU) polygon boundaries framing the data-center
campus AOI, pulled from the **USGS National Map Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)**
ArcGIS REST service. These are the source geometry the bundle's `watershed`
GeoJSON feed (issue #61) is assembled from, for the watershed map (#72).

## Source

- **USGS National Map WBD** — `https://hydro.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/rest/services/wbd/MapServer`
  (the seamless national WBD; HU-level sublayers keyed by digit count: layer 6 =
  12-digit Subwatershed, layer 5 = 10-digit Watershed, layer 4 = 8-digit Subbasin).
- Pulled by the `watermark.hydrology.connectors.wbd` connector; **regenerable** with:

  ```sh
  bosc wbd --write              # the campus AOI's HU12 + HU10, default
  bosc wbd --levels 12,10,8 --write   # add the coarser HU8 Subbasin too
  bosc wbd --point -84.1234,40.7969 --write   # any WGS84 point
  ```

  The AOI defaults to the `data-center-campus` tracking-site POI's bbox centroid
  (`data/poi/data-center-campus.md`); the connector selects the HU **containing**
  that point at each level. Raw responses cache under the git-ignored
  `data/cache/hydrology/wbd/`; the committed fixture for the offline test lives at
  `tests/fixtures/hydrology/wbd/`.

## Files

| File | HUC | HU level | km² | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `041000070404-pike-run.geojson` | `041000070404` | HU12 Subwatershed | 34.3 | the campus's immediate subwatershed; drains to `041000070406` |
| `0410000704-middle-ottawa-river.geojson` | `0410000704` | HU10 Watershed | 272.5 | the Ottawa River watershed through Lima |

Each file is a one-feature GeoJSON `FeatureCollection`; the HU attributes (`huc`,
`name`, `area_sqkm`, `to_huc`, …) ride on the feature `properties`, with full
provenance in the top-level `meta`.

## Scope / gaps

- **The campus sits in the Pike Run subwatershed (HU12) of the Middle Ottawa River
  watershed (HU10).** The hydrologic lineage continues outward —
  Ottawa River → **Auglaize** subbasin (HU8 `04100007`) → **Maumee** subregion
  (HU4 `0410`) → Lake Erie. The coarser Subbasin/basin polygons are **not committed
  here**: a ~1 MB Subbasin outline adds little to a campus-scale map. Pull them on
  demand with `--levels 12,10,8` (or query the WBD service directly) if needed.
- Geometry is **verbatim** from the WBD (WGS84 / EPSG:4326), display-only — never
  reprojected or simplified. The names ("Pike Run", "Middle Ottawa River") are the
  USGS WBD names; the project's informal "Lost Creek / Maumee watershed" framing maps
  to this real HU nesting.
