# Hydrology reference parameters

Committed reference inputs for the water-balance / stormwater model
(`bosc.hydrology`). These are **published reference values / standing assumptions**,
not document-derived figures — each is consumed as a tagged hydrology input
(`assumption`/`reference`), distinct from live connector pulls (USGS, NOAA, ECHO)
which are cached, not committed here.

## Files

| File | What | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `cn-lookup.yaml` | SCS Curve Numbers by NLCD land-cover class × hydrologic soil group (AMC-II), plus the dry/wet AMC adjustment forms. | USDA NRCS TR-55 Table 2-2, mapped to NLCD 2021 classes (same mapping Periplus used). |
| `low-flow-7q10.yaml` | Cited 7Q10 (7-day, 10-year) low-flow statistics for the receiving waters. | As cited; the regulatory statistic used by `bosc.hydrology.lowflow`. |
| `routing.yaml` | Discharge routing: which stream each WWTP discharges to (`wwtp_receiving`, the assimilative-screen denominator, externalized from `bosc.hydrology.balance`), and where the BOSC campus sends its own wastewater by forcemain (`bosc_routing`). Each route is `status: confirmed` (cited) or `theorized`. **BOSC output is confirmed to Lima (FM-2) + American Bath/II (FM-1); Shawnee II's FM-3 is theorized and excluded.** | Ohio EPA NPDES fact sheets + Periplus `watch-items.geojson`; loaded by `bosc.hydrology.routing`. |
| `sanitary-basis.yaml` | Sanitary-flow basis parameters for the loop. | Reference basis. |
| `maumee-tmdl-wla.yaml` | Individual NPDES total-phosphorus wasteload allocations (spring-season + daily) for the Lima-loop facilities. | Transcribed verbatim from the final Maumee Watershed Nutrient TMDL, Appendix 4 (`data/documents/maumee-tmdl/`); `source: document`. |
| `maumee-tmdl-budget.yaml` | The watershed-level TMDL phosphorus budget (loading capacity) the WLAs sit inside: Table 1A (boundary + WLA + LA + MOS + AFG = 914.4 mt/spring), the ~40% reduction mandate (Annex 4 spring targets 860 mt TP / 186 mt DRP at Waterville; 2008 baseline 1,414.1 mt), and the tiny ~1.4–1.5 mt/spring future-growth allowance — the assimilative-capacity *ceiling*. | Transcribed verbatim from the final TMDL main report + US EPA Decision Document Att.1 (`data/documents/maumee-tmdl/`); `source: document`. |
| `ottawa-lima-tmdl.yaml` | The six near-field TMDLs (Appendix 5) — esp. the **Ottawa River (Lima Area) TMDL** (US EPA-approved 2014-04-15), the loop's own receiving water, whose impairment was "exacerbated by chronic low flow conditions" + its prior per-facility TP WLAs; plus the Tetra Tech WWTP P-removal cost evaluation (Appendix 6) framing. | Transcribed verbatim from the final TMDL Appendices 5 & 6 (`data/documents/maumee-tmdl/`); `source: document`. |
| `maumee-tmdl-responsiveness.yaml` | Digest of the TMDL Responsiveness Summary: the design-flow increases baked into the WLAs (**Shawnee #2 2.0→3.0 MGD**, Elida 0.5→0.8 MGD, Wapakoneta 4.0→6.0), the **new/expanding-discharger rule** (justify added load vs the limited AFG; install treatment to meet a 0.5 mg/L individual TP limit), local commenters (Lima Refinery, PCS Nitrogen, Village of Elida, AMWA), and the CAFO/nonpoint themes. | Transcribed verbatim from the TMDL Responsiveness Summary (`data/documents/maumee-tmdl/`); `source: document`. |
| `campus-floodzone.yaml` | Whether the recorded campus parcels sit in — or near — the FEMA Special Flood Hazard Area. | Spatial intersect of the Bistrozzi footprint with the FEMA DFIRM (panel 39003C) via the City of Lima GIS floodzone layer (`bosc floodzone --footprint`); `source: connector`. |
| `wwtp-floodzone.yaml` | FEMA flood exposure of the three county WWTP discharge points (point-in-polygon + 50/150/400 m buffers). | Facility coordinates from EPA ECHO (`data/reference/echo/`) tested against the FEMA DFIRM (panel 39003C); `source: connector`. ECHO coords are a proxy for the outfall. |
| `nasa-power-climatology.yaml` | Monthly + annual climate normals (corrected precip, temperature, humidity, wind, solar) at the Lima loop point — the long-run water-budget context for the design-storm analysis. | NASA POWER climatology point API (AWS Open Data `s3://nasa-power`), pulled via `bosc nasa-power --write`; `source: connector`. Climate *normals*, distinct from the NOAA Atlas-14 design-storm *extremes*. |
| `atlas14-corridor-ddf.yaml` | NOAA Atlas-14 depth-duration-frequency table (depths in inches) for the Cole St / Bluelick corridor centroid — the 60-min through 24-hr design storms at the 2/10/25/50/100-yr return periods. The regulatory design rainfall the OPC drainage scope must meet (`bosc drainage-audit`). | NOAA Atlas-14 PDS point query, pulled via `bosc drainage-audit --write-ddf`; `source: connector`. Design-storm *extremes*, distinct from the NASA POWER *normals*. |

## Caveats

These are inputs, not measurements. The `cn-lookup` AMC formulas note which form is
actually applied in code. The 7Q10 here is the **cited regulatory** value — the USGS
NWIS connector only sanity-checks it against observed minimum discharge, it does not
replace it.
