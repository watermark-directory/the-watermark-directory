# Ohio LSC Status Report of Legislation

Per–General Assembly **Status Report of Legislation** published by the Ohio
**Legislative Service Commission (LSC)** at `statusreport.lsc.ohio.gov`. Every
measure, sponsor, date, and status code here was read **verbatim** from LSC's own
status-report workbook — nothing is fabricated, inferred, or normalized away.
Regenerate with `bosc lsc` (defaults to the GA in `settings.lsc_default_ga`).

## Source

For a GA, LSC offers the whole report as one authoritative spreadsheet:

```
https://statusreport.lsc.ohio.gov/<ga>/files/<ga>th-ga-status-report.xlsx
```

(e.g. `…/136/files/136th-ga-status-report.xlsx`). The browseable HTML index only
carries number/sponsor/title; the **xlsx** is the source of truth — it adds the
legislative-milestone columns. The connector parses that workbook with the Python
standard library (no openpyxl dependency).

## Files

`status-report.<ga>.yaml` — one `meta:` provenance block + a `bills:` list. Each
bill carries its normalized `identifier` (e.g. `HB 1`), the published `bill_type`
(`H. B.`, `S. R.`, …), `number`, primary `sponsors`, `short_title`, per-chamber
`house` / `senate` milestone blocks (`introduced`, `cmte_assigned`,
`cmte_reported`, `passed_3rd`), then `to_conf_cmte`, `concurrence`, `gov_action`,
`effective_date`, and the running `note`. `null` is a genuinely empty cell.

The `meta.as_of` field carries the workbook's own "Reflects legislative action
through …" banner, so the data is self-dating; output is deterministic (no
generation timestamp), so re-running regenerates identical bytes.

## Gaps / caveats

- **Primary sponsors only.** The workbook exposes two sponsor columns, so only the
  primary sponsor(s) are captured — not the full co-sponsor list (that lives on
  each bill's detail page, `…/<ga>/<bill>`).
- **Raw dates/codes.** Dates and committee codes are kept exactly as published,
  including trailing chamber markers (e.g. a date suffixed `S`). They are *not*
  parsed into ISO dates, so downstream code should not assume a fixed format.
- **Status, not full history.** This is the milestone snapshot LSC compiles; the
  blow-by-blow legislative history of a single bill is on its detail page.
- **As-of dated.** The workbook reflects action through the date in `meta.as_of`;
  re-run `bosc lsc` to refresh.
