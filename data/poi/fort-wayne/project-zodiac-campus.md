Composite POI of the **11 Hatchworks LLC parcels** that make up the Project Zodiac data-center
campus in southeast Fort Wayne, Allen County, **Indiana** — the network's first confirmed
operational data-center facility ([`datacenter-facility.md`](../../extracted/fort-wayne/datacenter-facility.md),
#360). It is the active imagery tracking site (`depth: watched`); the AOI `bbox` here — derived
from the committed parcel geometry — is what `bosc imagery search/pull` clips to.

Geometry and identity are the Allen County, IN CAMA parcels listed in `parcels` (the county
iMap `QueryLayers` Parcel_Poly layer, owner-of-record joined), committed verbatim as
[`bosc-parcels.geojson`](../../reference/fort-wayne/bosc-parcels.geojson). The campus grouping is
an analyst composite, not a county object; member parcels are not yet broken out as atomic POIs.

**The assemblage tells the story.** The block was bought in **two waves** — four parcels in
January 2024 (around the April 2024 $2B groundbreaking) and seven more on **2025-10-31** (the
Phase II/III expansion). Every parcel is held by **Hatchworks LLC**, a Delaware-registered-agent
shell (mailing `2801 Centerville Rd, Wilmington DE 19808`) — except the situs parcel **6015 Adams
Center Rd**, whose owner mailing is **Mountain View, CA 94043**: the on-record link from the shell
to **Google**, the operator the local "Project Zodiac" filings keep at arm's length.
