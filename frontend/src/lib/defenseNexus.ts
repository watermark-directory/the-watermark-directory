/**
 * Defense-nexus map model (#233 interactive layer for docs/defense-nexus.md).
 *
 * The essay's spine is a single discipline: geographic adjacency, a capability,
 * and a named market segment are an *inferred* connection — raised as a question,
 * never asserted. This build-time model backs the interactive companion that makes
 * that visible: the campus footprint and the JSMC (US-owned) footprint drawn on one
 * map, with the **measured gap between them computed from the cited geometry**.
 *
 * The number matters. The prose first reached for "two miles" / "the next parcels
 * over"; the parcels themselves say otherwise — the nearest campus and JSMC parcels
 * are ~5.5 mi apart, centers ~6.6 mi. Computing it here keeps the page honest and
 * keeps "proximity is not connection" landing on a real distance, not a vibe.
 *
 * Build-time only: imports the node:fs bundle loader (the island gets the result as
 * a prop, never imports this). Guarded on `hasFeed` so an incomplete bundle renders
 * the prose without crashing the build.
