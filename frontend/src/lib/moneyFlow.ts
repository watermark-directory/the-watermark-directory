/**
 * Build-time data for the Cost chapter's follow-the-money flow (#222 → #223).
 * The public's roadwork money, traced: $14.5M "Company Contribution" collected up
 * front → the Tetra Tech OPC estimate (6 corridor line items) → the first actual
 * award (Eagle Bridge, far under) → the §5.5 grant-refund arrow back to the
 * developer. Plus the parallel abatement strand.
 *
 * The OPC line items + total are read from the `records` feed (the same numbers
 * the library renders — no fork). The contribution, the actual award, and the
 * abatement terms are cited constants from the committed extractions (the RDA, the
 * PAAC minutes, the CRA, ECONOMICS.md) — those records aren't in the `records`
 * feed. NOT client-safe (imports the node bundle loader); the island consumes the
 * plain `MoneyFlowData` object this returns, passed as a prop.
 *
 * Discipline: the §5.5 refund consequence is flagged `[inference]` (it turns on
 * grant awards not in the document). The abatement value **per job** is the
 * deciding number, and the record that would pin it — the School District
 * Compensation Agreement — is non-public (`cra-agreement.cra.yaml`
 * `amounts_public: false`). Rather than leave the blank or invent a figure, it is
 * carried as a transparent **[open] screening model** (`buildAbatementPerJob`): a
 * best-effort band across a few facility profiles, every constant labeled, the
 * actual number still owed to the record. The defense/GovCloud-hardened case is
 * one modeling profile — a what-if on the building share + staffing, NOT a claim
 * the facility is defense (that thread stays [open], tracked in #233).
