/**
 * The narrative content collection (issue #69): the public prose under `docs/`
 * surfaced in the Astro site.
 *
 * Single-source decision: `docs/` STAYS at the repo root — it's also the legacy
 * Python SSG's input (`bosc.site.build` mirrors it) and general repo docs, so the
 * frontend reads it *as-is* (a content collection over `../docs`), never moving or
 * editing it. Cross-links are rewritten at build time by the rehype plugin
 * (`rehype-doc-links.ts`) so the source stays valid for both tiers.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for which docs are published, their
 * slugs/titles/sections, and the legacy→IA link map — consumed by the route, the
 * search index, AND the rehype plugin (via astro.config).
