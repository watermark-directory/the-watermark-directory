/**
 * The redesigned site's information architecture: four header sections, each
 * with a minimal table of contents (Epic #54 / issue #64). This is the single
 * source of truth — the header tabs, the per-section TOC rail, and the
 * build-time search index all read it.
 *
 * Each TOC `anchor` is an `id` the section's landing page renders, so the rail
 * links, the on-page scroll-spy, and search deep-links all resolve to a real
 * heading. The full per-item pages land in #65–#68.
