/**
 * The site's information architecture. Two related models:
 *
 *  - `SECTIONS` — the **content areas**, each with a minimal table of contents
 *    (the per-section TOC rail, the search index, and the docs grouping read it).
 *  - `NETWORK_TABS` / `SITE_TABS` / `PLATFORM_LINKS` — the **header bar**
 *    presentation (design "Global Chrome"): a two-tier bar whose left tabs swap
 *    by tier, plus the constant platform cluster on the right.
 *
 * A page declares its `section`; the header resolves which tab is active via
 * `navItemActive` (so the Watershed sub-area lights the Corpus tab, etc.).
 *
 * Each TOC `anchor` is an `id` the section's landing page renders, so the rail
 * links, the on-page scroll-spy, and search deep-links all resolve to a real
 * heading.
 *
 * Routes are built from `SITE_BASE` / `STORY_BASE` (src/lib/routes.ts) — the live
 * site lives under `/network/<id>` (was `/bosc`) and the story beneath it.
