/**
 * The withholding stack (#224) — Project BOSC's layered records-withholding
 * architecture, the Opacity chapter's spine. Grounded layer-for-layer in
 * `data/extracted/legal/prr-mandamus/records-withholding-map.yaml` (`the_stack[]`):
 * seven lawful-looking layers along the records lifecycle, each with its operative
 * clause and the committed document it lives in.
 *
 * Discipline (held from the source): every clause / statute is `[verified]` from a
 * committed extraction; the **"engineered system" reading is argument**, and the
 * record labels it as such — `STACK_THESIS`/`STACK_CLOSE` keep that explicit.
