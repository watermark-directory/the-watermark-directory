/**
 * The legal-history collection (Pages cutover Gap B, #105): substantive primary
 * records under `data/extracted/` that the legacy "Legal history" nav exposed —
 * Select Committee testimony + hearing transcripts, the PRR/mandamus analyses, the
 * corpus-completeness audit, the web-vendor audit, and the commissioners record.
 *
 * Like `lib/narrative.ts` / `lib/reference.ts`, this is the single source of truth
 * for which extracted docs are published, their slugs/titles/groups, and (via
 * `PUBLISHED_LEGAL`) the link-rewrite map the rehype plugin consults so intra-set
 * cross-links resolve to their `/site/legal/<slug>` routes. The source is read
 * AS-IS — never moved or edited (the legacy Python SSG also renders it).
