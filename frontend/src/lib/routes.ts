 * `/network/<id>` so they're clean siblings, and an investigation is a *story* beneath a
 * site (so a site can host several over time — `/network/<id>/stories/<codename>`).
 *
 * The parameterized core (`siteBase`/`storyBase`) keys off the registry `slug` (the same
 * key the Python `bosc.sites` peer uses for facility maps, grouping, …). Lima is the one
 * site whose URL id differs from its slug (`lima` → `american-sugar-creek-allen-co`, the
 * historical re-root); every other site's URL id IS its slug. This map is the only place
 * that special case lives — it stays here (not in `sites.ts`) so this module keeps its
 * zero-dependency contract and `sites.ts` can import `siteBase` from it without a cycle.
