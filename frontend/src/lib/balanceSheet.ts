/**
 * The public balance sheet (epic #271 Phase 4 capstone, #273) — composes every
 * narrative's `UncertainOutcome` into one register-encoded sheet and prices the opacity
 * in aggregate. **No new data:** it reads the existing consumer models (econ ledger, grid,
 * toxics) through the shared band contract the engine was built to feed from day one.
 *
 * Client-safe. The toxics outcome needs the feed-sourced discharge constants (effluent +
 * natural low flow), so they're passed in (from `buildDilution()` at build time) rather
 * than re-derived — the balance sheet never forks a narrative's numbers.
 *
 * Discipline: a map of what *isn't* known, not a verdict. The aggregate is a band; every
 * row carries its register and the specific record whose disclosure would collapse it.
