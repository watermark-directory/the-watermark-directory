/**
 * Open leads (design "Site Leads") — the presentation vocabulary + helpers for a site's
 * open-leads board.
 *
 * The lead DATA is now a per-site bundle feed (`leads`, #796), read from each site's committed
 * `data/site/leads.yaml` — so a peer carries its own leads, not Lima's. This module is what's
 * left once the data moved out: the `Lead` shape (the feed row type), the kind/status/filter
 * presentation maps, the (Lima-curated, presentation-only) `RECENTLY_CLOSED` + `LEAD_LIFECYCLE`
 * rails, and the `leadStats` / `leadCount` reducers — all now taking the feed's leads as input.
 *
 * PROVENANCE DISCIPLINE (enforced in the feed model `bosc.site.feeds.LeadItem`): a lead is
 * *unverified inference until a source corroborates it* — its evidence `tag` is only ever `open`
 * (a documented gap) or `inference` (a labeled reading), never `verified`, and `source` names
 * where the gap is recorded. No fabricated contributors or timestamps.
