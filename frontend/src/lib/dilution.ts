/**
 * Build-time data for the Water chapter (#222, corrected pass). Two *distinct*
 * water stories the corpus keeps separate (and an earlier draft conflated):
 *
 *  1. **The discharge story — "the river is already effluent"** (`discharge`).
 *     What the campus discharges *into*: at design low flow the county WWTP
 *     discharges + the campus's routed FM-2 industrial discharge vastly exceed the
 *     streams' natural low flow — the Ottawa leaving Lima runs ~93% treated
 *     effluent. `[verified: document]` from the NPDES fact sheets (the feed's
 *     `assimilative` rows) + the cited water balance.
 *  2. **The consumptive-draw story** (`floors` + the draw model). What the campus
 *     takes *out of the basin*: the net evaporative loss (feed `consumptive_loss`),
 *     a permanent basin loss. The campus draws from Lima's **off-stream reservoirs
 *     (filled at high flow), NOT the Ottawa** — so setting the loss against the
 *     river's low flow is a basin-scale **worst-case bound**, carried as
 *     `[inference]`, never a river withdrawal.
 *
 * Figures come from the `hydrology-scenarios` feed (the same numbers the hydrology
 * dashboard renders — no fork): the buildout cooling demand / consumptive fraction
 * / consumptive loss, the assimilative discharge rows, and `ottawa_7q10`. The
 * seasonal floors (summer 30Q10, driest 1Q10) and the campus FM-2 discharge are
 * cited constants. NOT client-safe; the island consumes the plain `DilutionData`.
