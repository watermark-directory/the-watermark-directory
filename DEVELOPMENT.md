# Development

## Toolchain

Managed by [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (Python 3.11, uv, node 24, git-lfs).
`brew bundle` is the fallback (`Brewfile` lists the same tools).

```bash
mise install          # provision pinned tools
mise run setup        # uv sync --extra dev + git lfs install
cp .env.example .env  # set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (+ WATERMARK_SITE if needed)
```

The repo is a **mise monorepo**: the backend (repo root) and `web/` each
have their own task set. A bare task name runs the project you are standing in;
`//web:<task>` targets the web project from anywhere.

## Task reference

### Backend

```bash
mise run check    # gate: ruff + format-check + markdown + mypy strict + pytest
mise run test     # pytest only
mise run lint     # ruff check
mise run types    # mypy
mise run fmt      # ruff format (auto-fix)
mise run export   # run watermark export → data/site/bundle/
mise run dev -- … # run the watermark CLI
```

### Frontend (Astro)

```bash
mise run //web:check      # gate: Biome + Markdown + astro check + vitest + build + links
mise run //web:dev        # astro dev server  → http://localhost:4321
mise run //web:test       # vitest only
mise run //web:lint       # biome ci
mise run //web:markdown   # markdownlint over web/**/*.md (web/.markdownlint-cli2.yaml)
mise run //web:fmt        # biome format (auto-fix) + markdownlint --fix
mise run //web:build      # static build  → web/dist/
mise run //web:dev:stack  # wrangler + mocked externals (Pages Functions)
```

### Whole-repo

```bash
mise run ci           # runs both check gates
mise tasks --all      # list every task
```

### Data tasks

```bash
mise run oepa-permit <permit_id> <site>   # fetch → ingest → extract → catalog sync
```

After adding or editing an extraction, sync the data catalog (see
[CONTRIBUTING.md → Adding extractions](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-extractions)):

```bash
watermark catalog reconcile      # refresh _observed.yaml
watermark catalog audit --apply  # apply inferred fields
watermark catalog check          # gate — must pass before committing
```

### Staleness — a report, never a gate

```bash
watermark corpus staleness          # which registers/watches have aged out of their cadence
watermark corpus staleness --json   # the same reduction, machine-readable
watermark corpus staleness -v       # include the current subjects
```

Always exits 0, on the `mise run yidam-vendor-status` precedent: the answer to "this register is
86 days old" is a human deciding whether the world moved, not a failed build. Nothing in CI
consumes it and nothing should.

It measures every data-center register and standing watch on **three independently authored
axes** — the date the file claims for itself, the last commit touching its path (`git log %aI`,
author date, because a rebase rewrites committer dates), and a cadence declared somewhere else
again (the catalog entry for a register, a dated trigger for a watch). That independence is the
point: a check that parsed a register's own `Status **as of …**` line and compared it to nothing
would only confirm the file says what it says (the #2069 lesson).

Four standings, and **nothing unknowable is reported as fresh**:

- `overdue` — a cadence exists and the subject is past it.
- `current` — a cadence exists and the subject is within it.
- `uncheckable` — the declared cadence is `on-demand` or `static`. Reported in its own section
  with a count, because a cadence that can never be overdue is a finding, not a pass.
- `unknown` — everything absent or unreadable: no catalog entry, a prose date the regex cannot
  read, a cadence written in English, a watch with no top-level dated trigger. Never `current`.

Two things it deliberately refuses to do. A **slug-scoped template** catalog entry
(`extracted/{site}/data-centers.md`) nominally matches every register and shares one
`last_refreshed`, so honouring its cadence would announce full coverage over registers that have
no entry of their own — a template-only match resolves to `unknown`. And a watch's `next_check`
**nested inside a thread** does not count: that is how `van-wert/water-watch.yaml` ran thirty days
late against a trigger sitting on its first pull entry.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` uses a `changes` job to gate the two halves:

- **Python `check` job** (ruff/format/mypy/pytest) — runs when `src/`, `tests/`,
  `data/`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, or `mise.toml` changed.
- **Astro `web` job** — runs when `web/` changed.
- Either `mise.toml` or `ci.yml` edit triggers both.

`check` is the one **required** status check on `main`. Filtering is at the job
level (skipped job = success), not the workflow trigger level (path-filtered
workflow = stuck pending). Don't add a top-level `paths:` to `ci.yml`.

Markdown is a **separate required CI check**: any PR that adds or edits `.md`
files runs `pnpm exec markdownlint-cli2`. Config in `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`;
generated docs are excluded. Run it locally before pushing.

## Settings

Never read `os.environ` directly — use `watermark.config.get_settings()`.
Settings are `WATERMARK_`-prefixed. Key ones:

| Env var | Default | What |
|---|---|---|
| `WATERMARK_SITE` | `lima` | Active site slug |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Required for agent/extract |
| `WATERMARK_MODEL` | `claude-opus-4-8` | Research agent model |
| `WATERMARK_EXTRACT_MODEL` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Bulk extraction model |
| `WATERMARK_DATA_DIR` | `data/` | Root data directory |

The `--site` flag on the root CLI writes `WATERMARK_SITE` to the env before the
first `get_settings()` call — that is the one sanctioned `os.environ` write.

## Testing

Tests are hermetic — no network. Hydrology/connector tests use the `hydro_settings`
fixture (`conftest.py`, `hydro_offline=True`, `hydro_fixtures_dir` →
`tests/fixtures/hydrology/`). A new connector needs a committed fixture; an
offline cache miss raises `HydroOfflineError` naming the key to record.

`test_extracted_yaml_valid.py` validates every committed extraction against
`watermark.models`. Adding extractions means keeping them schema-valid.

Tests run against committed `data/extracted/` (the reviewed artifact), not raw
`data/documents/`. If a live connector run populates `data/cache/` before a test
run it can pollute offline tests; remove `data/cache/{hydrology,economics}` if
tests fail spuriously after a live pull.

### Shard balance and `.test_durations`

CI splits the suite over six runners with pytest-split (`--splits 6 --group N`),
and `check` waits on the slowest shard. The split is balanced from the committed
`.test_durations` — and a test **missing** from that file is not skipped by the
balancer, it is priced at the *average* of the tests that are in it. So the file
does not degrade gracefully: let it go stale and the shards invert, with the
cheapest-looking shard running longest (#1772).

```bash
mise run test:durations   # full rebuild: pytest -n0 --store-durations --clean-durations
uv run pytest -n0 --store-durations tests/test_new.py   # merge one module in
```

`-n0` is required — durations have to be timed serially, since under xdist the
workers' clocks overlap. `tests/test_split_durations.py` fails the suite once
more than 10% of collected tests are unpriced, and names the modules to cover.

Record on a machine where the suite actually *runs*: a test that skips locally is
recorded at ~0 s and under-prices the CI shard that runs it for real. On macOS the
SWMM engine is the one that bites — ad-hoc sign it first, or `test_hydro_tier1.py`'s
engine tests skip out of the manifest.

```bash
codesign -s - -f .venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/swmm/toolkit/*.dylib
```

## Adding a site

1. `watermark sites new <slug>` — prints a paste-ready `SiteProfile` stub.
2. Fill every field from a cited source; `watermark onboard <slug> --check`
   flags unfilled placeholders.
3. Register in `web/packages/core/src/sites.ts` with `status: "open"`,
   `selectable: false`.
4. `watermark onboard <slug>` — scaffolds per-site data dirs, runs portable
   reach connectors, prints the blocking review checklist.
5. Promotion to `selectable: true` is a manual, parity-gated edit after the
   checklist clears.

See [docs/onboarding.md](docs/onboarding.md) for the full runbook.

## Frontend

The frontend is a self-contained Node project. It builds offline against the committed
per-site bundles in `web/sites/` (no Python, no LFS, no API keys). See
[web/README.md](web/README.md) for the Pages Functions (submit/ask/doc)
local testing approach, the wrangler dev stack, and the Cloudflare deployment.
