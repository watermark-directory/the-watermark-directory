The plainest way to say what this report is: there is a defense installation near
the campus, the developer has the credentials to do defense work, and an industry
witness told a state committee that hosting the government is a normal line of
business. Each of those is true. None of them, alone or together, shows that the
Lima campus does defense work. Holding those two sentences at once — the facts are
real, the conclusion is not earned — is the whole exercise.

It is worth saying who raised this first. The person who put the defense question to
Ohio's data-center committee is the relator behind this record, a cloud engineer who
builds for regulated industries — and he framed it, on the record, as a question he
could not answer: _"I can speculate there. I think you probably understand that most
of that is classified."_ He called the broader pattern _"likely speculative."_
`[verified: relator testimony, 2026-06-04]` If the witness who introduced the thread
labels it speculation, a page assembled from the public record has no business doing
less.

## the geography is real

Roughly two miles from the campus corridor sits the **Joint Systems Manufacturing
Center** — the Lima Army Tank Plant — operated by **General Dynamics Land Systems**.
It is not a rumor; it is on the parcel map. The corpus carries it as five contiguous
parcels totaling **~384 acres**, every one of them owned, in the auditor's own field,
by **"UNITED STATES."** `[verified: data/site/bundle/feeds/geo/jsmc.geojson]` GDLS's
operation of the plant is a matter of public record `[reference]`.

So the corridor contains, within a few miles of each other, the largest data-center
build in the county's history and one of the country's two heavy-armor manufacturing
plants. That is a striking adjacency. It is also _only_ an adjacency — two facts
that share a map, which is precisely the kind of connection the method says to raise
as a question and stop.

## the capability is real

The developer is Google `[verified, #234]`, and Google can, as a technical and
contractual matter, do high-authorization government work. The relator testified —
with sources in his written submission — that **Google has achieved IL-6**, the DoD
impact level for data classified up to SECRET `[verified: relator testimony;
reference: DoD CC SRG]`. Google's air-gapped Distributed Cloud appliance holds DoD
IL5 `[reference]`. The federal market is not hypothetical for the industry, either:
before the same committee, **AWS named the Department of War and the CIA** among
"11,000 government agencies of all classification levels" `[verified: hearing
record, 2026-06-04 morning panel]`, and the relator tied the timing to **Executive
Order 14265** (signed 2025-04-09), which pressed defense primes to modernize cloud
procurement `[verified]`.

The capability has an economic edge the rest of the record sharpens. Government cloud
runs **20–30% above commercial** rates, and — the relator's point — an authorized
facility is closed to the community that subsidized it: _"I cannot use that data
center if it is a FedRAMP-compliant facility."_ `[verified: relator testimony]` That
is why the question is not idle. _If_ the campus were a high-authorization enclave,
the public-benefit math the abatement was scored on would not hold — a sealed federal
supply chain seeds no local cluster (see [end-use-and-workloads.md](end-use-and-workloads.md)).
But that is an _if_, and the record does not resolve it.

## proximity is not connection

Set the three confirmed facts down together: a defense plant nearby, a developer with
the clearances, an industry that markets to the government. The temptation is to let
them lean on each other until they look like a finding. The method forbids it,
explicitly: name-proximity, temporal coincidence, and geographic adjacency are the
signatures of an _inferred_ connection, and an inferred connection is never a fact.

Nothing in the corpus ties the campus to the plant, to GDLS, or to a defense
workload. There is no contract, no filing, no dated communication naming both. The
adjacency to the JSMC is geography; the IL-6 credential is a capability Google holds
everywhere it operates, not a fact about Lima; the AWS testimony is about AWS. Each
thread, followed honestly, ends without reaching the campus.

The committee record is consistent with that limit rather than against it. Google's
own witness testified to Ohio's data centers and **did not name Lima at all**
`[verified, #234]` — the silence is documented; what it means is `[inference]`, not a
finding.

## the wall of "no records"

There is one place the record could have spoken, and the answer it gave is its own
kind of fact. The public-records request asked the County for any communications
between it and **the DoD or its contractors — GDIT, GDLS** — concerning the facility
or the corridor. The County's response: **"No records."** It asserts that none exist
on its side. `[verified: bosc-prr-production-2026-06-05.response-index.yaml, item 2]`

A clean negative is a result, and it should be stated cleanly: on the County's
account, there is no documented defense channel. But "no records" is not quite a
no-link finding, because elsewhere in the same production the phrase did heavier
lifting than it should have — conflating _"we do not hold it"_ with _"it does not
exist"_ `[verified: same index]`. So the honest reading is narrow: the County holds
no such records, or produced none. That forecloses one avenue. It does not establish
that the connection is absent, and it does not establish that it is present. It
leaves the question exactly where it was — open, and now with one door confirmed shut.

## where this stops

What would actually close it is small and specific: the facility's **authorization
posture** — whether it carries any FedRAMP or DoD impact-level authorization — is a
single disclosable fact that would answer the end-use question and this one at once.
It is not in the record. The relator's sixth recommendation to the committee was that
it should be `[verified: relator testimony]`. Until it is disclosed, the question is
held open by two things at once: the classification that would keep a real defense
use quiet, and the "no records" wall that keeps even the absence of one unproven.

That is an uncomfortable place to end, and it is the correct one. A defense nexus is
not a finding of this record. It is a question the record raises by what it contains —
a federal plant on the next parcels over, a developer cleared to SECRET, a procurement
order, an industry that hosts the CIA — and cannot answer by what it withholds. The
walk's discipline was built for exactly this thread: to let the reader see the
question clearly without being handed a conclusion the evidence has not earned. The
honest end is the open one.
