/**
 * The impact study — each site's primary artifact (epic: the missing impact study).
 *
 * Communities facing a data-center (or similar industrial-water-user) project never receive
 * the environmental + economic impact study that should precede abatements and rezonings. The
 * platform already computes the ingredients; this module assembles them into that study's
 * **data spine**: a fixed, site-generic chapter registry whose every chapter renders either
 * the screen the record supports or the gap **as a finding** — "a real impact study would
 * report X; the record needed to compute it has not been produced."
 *
 * Three disciplines govern this module:
 *
 *  - **The study never locks.** An absent feed is *content* (the absence register), so status
 *    derivation composes the same primitives readiness reads (`hasFeed` row counts,
 *    `coolingMethodUndisclosed`, `facilityState`) into a per-chapter *verdict*
 *    (`data | partial | gap | na`) — never into a `SectionLocked`. A facility-less site still
 *    has a study: its baseline chapters are real reported content and its project-dependent
 *    chapters read `na` (watch state), not `gap` — "no project ⇒ nothing to say" is exactly
 *    the framing this artifact exists to refute.
 *  - **Verdicts measure the record, not the lifecycle.** Row counts + content probes decide
 *    status; a facility's `investigation → live` clock changes framing copy only.
 *  - **Multi-project forward-compat, no compute change.** Every function threads an optional
 *    `facilityKey` (nothing passes one today) and the model carries it, so a second campus
 *    later gets its own study rows without rearchitecting. Facility-scoped routes are
 *    reserved under `/study/f/<facility-key>/…` — the `f/` prefix means a chapter id and a
 *    facility key can never collide (and no chapter may ever take the id `f`). No "the
 *    campus" singletons live here: copy reads the resolved facility's own name.
 *
 * **The Python seam.** `StudyChapterModel` is plain JSON keyed by `(chapter, facility_key)` —
 * deliberately the shape of a future `impact-study` bundle feed. `studyChapterModel` prefers
 * that feed wholesale when a bundle ships it; today's TS composers (each a thin read over the
 * existing builders) are the fallback that the feed will replace row-for-row. Everything the
 * study's surfaces render (cover strip, chapter header, annex rollup) reads ONLY
 * `chapterAvailability` / `studyChapterModel`, never raw feeds — that is the seam.
 *
 * NOT client-safe (imports the node bundle loader) — pages render these plain objects.
