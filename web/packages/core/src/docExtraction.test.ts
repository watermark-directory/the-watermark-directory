  // `usace/west-union/` and are subtracted from the reference build's corpus scope.
  // 3,254 -> 3,348 (#2072 follow-on): 93 `oepa/lima/edoc-*.pdf` — the enforcement, inspection and
  // permit-action tranche of the City of Lima WWTP's NPDES record on permit 2PE00000 — plus
  // `plans/4091285.pdf`. The portal pull resolved 261 documents and all were fetched, but the
  // repository had exceeded its Git-LFS budget, so 168 (1.35 GB of routine reports, monitoring and
  // application packages) were deliberately NOT committed; every deferred docid is recorded in
  // `data/research/oepa-portal-2pe00000-2026-08-22/manifest.yaml` and is re-fetchable. The comment
  // here said 3,516 for one release — the count as if all 261 had landed — while the assertion
  // below said 3,348. The assertion was right.
  // 68 -> 69 (#2075): `oepa/lima/edoc-412983.order.yaml`, the 2015 federal consent decree. The
  // first of the 93 to be read, and the first `order`-genre extraction Lima has.
  // 69 -> 85 (#2075 follow-on): the enforcement tranche — the 1994 DFFO, the 2005 U.S. EPA
  // administrative order, the 2016 NOV/ROV/incident-report burst, two City letters, the 2026 NOV,
  // and one misfiled Mansfield letter. Sixteen documents, all `order`.
  // 85 -> 115 (#2077): the 30 Ohio EPA inspection letters, under the `inspection` genre added for
  // them. They are 30 CAPTURES of 18 distinct inspections — the portal serves most of this plant's
  // inspections twice, once with a text layer and once as a scan — so the extracted COUNT is
  // captures, not inspections, and the twelve twin pairs are clustered in document-versions.yaml.
  // 115 -> 129 (#2078): the permit lifecycle — 2PE00000*MD/*ND/*OD/*PD across issued permits, draft
  // public notices and the 2023 fact sheet, plus seven permit ACTIONS and the 2022 renewal
  // application. Existing genres (`npdes`, `epa`); no contract change.
  // 129 -> 138 (#2079): the nine paragraph-33 semiannual progress reports, under the
  // `compliance-report` genre added for them. They are the decree's own measuring instrument.

  // application, three engineering drawings/reports, and City Ordinance 155-13 (hand-authored;
  // `resolution` has no extractor). Every Lima WWTP document that CAN be extracted now is.

  // still catalogued; they are simply not LIMA's. Ohio EPA's portal indexes by permit, and the
  // 2PE00000 sweep returned two other facilities' records — a Mansfield WWTP letter carrying
  // Lima's permit number in its own reference block (`edoc-3063821`) and a Henry County spill
  // report naming no permit at all (`edoc-3296496`). `data/extracted` mirrors an immutable
  // `data/documents`, so neither byte moved: `data/corpus-attribution.yaml` re-attributes them at
  // the read layer, the letter into Mansfield's corpus scope and the IPIR into no registered
  // site's. This denominator counts what LIMA's bundle publishes, so it falls by two — a
  // correction, not a regression. The percentage is unchanged at 4.6%.

  // POTW), shelved under `oepa/lima/`. ⚠️ THE PORTAL SERVES 23 ROWS AND THE DENOMINATOR MOVES BY

  // deferral. ⚠️ THE NUMERATOR MOVES BY ONE, AND THAT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN A GAP: only the
  // application form has a fitting genre (`npdes`). The two sampling reports were read and left
  // UNEXTRACTED because no genre fits an Indirect Discharge Permit Sampling Report and their
  // Group A results table is blank, so a model fitted to them would bake in the wrong shape; the

    // 160 -> 158 (#2085): the two Ohio EPA misfilings re-attributed away from Lima. Mansfield's
    // own bundle gains one of them, which is where the record was always supposed to be.
    // 158 -> 159 (#2088): `permits/4230060.epa.yaml`, which publishes into `permits-epa` as an
    // agency ACTION. Its companion `4230068.sanitary.yaml` does NOT appear, because `record:`
    // claims no group — the same gap noted on `counts.permits` above. One document, one record.
    // 159 -> 160 (#2089): `oepa/lima/edoc-4116201.npdes.yaml`, the indirect-discharge
    // application form, which publishes into `permits-npdes`. One record from twelve committed
    // documents, for the reason given above.
    // 160 -> 163: the TMDL allocation record, the 2DP00130 conveyance record and the BOSC §401
    // certification record — all three `permits-epa`, all three naming their source document.
    // 163 -> 164: `lima/council/…ord-198-26-data-center-moratorium.resolution.yaml`, the City of
    // Lima's eighteen-month data-center moratorium, publishing into `local-legislation` — the same
    // group the Van Wert and Sidney council resolutions use. One record from the two documents
    // acquired, for the `source.companion_file` reason given on the denominator above.
    // 164 -> 166 (the American Township CUP): TWO records off ONE document — the BZA decision
    // (`…2025-02-04-bza-2024-12-cup.resolution.yaml`) and the 2018 warranty deed bound into the
    // same packet (`…2018-03-16-churchill-neff.deed.yaml`). A compound source yields a record per
    // INSTRUMENT, which is why records move by two while the corpus moves by one.
    // 166 -> 188 (#2175): twenty-two records from twenty-two documents, one to one. Unlike the
    // American Township packet above, no document in this production carries two instruments and
    // no instrument spans two documents — so the record count, the join and the numerator all move
    // by the same twenty-two.
    expect(records.length).toBe(188);
    // 5 -> 3, and this is the deliberate change the note below predicted. `_source_ref` now
    // resolves three further committed provenance shapes — `provenance.source_path` /
    // `provenance.sources`, the connector read's `meta.sources` (a dict of NAMED lists, so every
    // list is scanned and not just `primary`), and a top-level `sources:` list of instrument
    // blocks. Before #1993, 28 of the 32 records it publishes would have carried no join at all.
    // What remains is genuinely unjoinable: the two OPC artifacts and one FEMA obligation, none of
    // which names a single source document.
    expect(records.filter((r) => !r.source_doc_rel).length).toBe(3);
    // The joinable side of the same 73 -> 74 -> 90: every one of these names its source document,
    // so the index gains an entry each rather than joining the three that name none.
    // 153 -> 154 (#2088): `4230060.epa.yaml` names its source document and so gains an index
    // entry. `4230068.sanitary.yaml` names one too, but never becomes a record at all (`record:`
    // claims no group), so it cannot reach this index — which is why the join moves by one while
    // the corpus moves by two.
    // 154 -> 155 (#2089): `oepa/lima/edoc-4116201.npdes.yaml` names its source document and so
    // gains an index entry. Here the join and the record move together — unlike #2088, this
    // extraction both becomes a record and names its source. The other eleven committed
    // documents of the package have no extraction at all and so reach neither side.
    // 155 -> 158: all three new records — the TMDL allocation, the 2DP00130 conveyance and the
    // BOSC §401 certifications — name a source document, so the join and the record move together
    // — as at #2089 and unlike #2088.
    // 158 -> 159: the moratorium record names the council packet as its source, so the join and the
    // record move together — as at #2089 and unlike #2088. The agenda reaches neither side.
    // 159 -> 160: the two American Township records name one packet between them, so the index
    // gains a single key. See the `countExtracted` note above.
    // 160 -> 182: each of the twenty-two names its own source document, so the join gains a key
    // per record — the one-to-one case, as at #2089.
    expect(index.size).toBe(182);
