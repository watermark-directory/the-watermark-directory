/**
 * The Ask-portal faithfulness eval set (#215).
 *
 * Two tiers run against these fixtures:
 *  - the **fixture tier** (askEval.test.ts) is deterministic and always runs in CI: it
 *    asserts retrieval grounding (in-corpus questions surface the right source) and the
 *    deterministic refusal (out-of-corpus questions retrieve nothing, so the endpoint
 *    refuses before any model call) — guarding against retrieval/prompt regressions.
 *  - the **live tier** (askEval.live.test.ts) is gated on ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and actually
 *    calls the model, asserting grounded answers cite and hallucination-bait is refused.
 *
 * The corpus below is a compact stand-in for the real bundle's domains (OPC estimates,
 * permits, the confidentiality agreement, corridor entities, commissioners' meetings, the
 * glossary) — enough for BM25 to separate on-topic from off-topic deterministically.
