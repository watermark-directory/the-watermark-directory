/**
 * Per-site section readiness (#781) — the gating engine for a partial network site.
 *
 * A new watershed-point site rarely has the whole record on day one (Fort Wayne today: the
 * Project Zodiac campus + rsei/econ/network slices, but no timeline / people / exhibits). The
 * site must still be navigable and useful, and actively solicit sources — so each section is
 * classified `available` or `locked` from what *that site's* bundle actually carries, never from
 * Lima's. Pages read this to either render their real partial data or show a coherent "not on the
 * record yet" lock with a contribute CTA: degrade, don't break; lock what isn't ready; and — the
 * repo's spine — never fabricate Lima's record onto a thinner peer.
 *
 * The reference build (Lima) is the deliberate exception: it hosts the network-global narrative
 * and leads (the root `/reports`, `/leads` read it), so its sections are always `available`
 * regardless of counts. Mirrors the backend reference-host asymmetry (`bosc.sites`).
 *
 * Gating is read off the bundle `manifest.json` feed counts (+ the site registry for the story),
 * so it's pure and testable: the committed `sample-bundle/{lima,fort-wayne}` fixtures are a real
 * full-vs-partial pair the unit tests pin against.
